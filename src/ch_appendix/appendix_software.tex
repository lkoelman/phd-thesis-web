\section*{List of software used}

The following software was used for the implementation and analysis of neuronal network
and cell models in this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The NEURON simulation environment by \cite{hines_neuron_1997} (\url{https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/})
    \item PyNN: a Python package for simulator-independent specification of neuronal network models by \cite{davison_pynn_2008} (\url{http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/})
    \item Blender, an open source 3D creation suite (\url{https://www.blender.org/})
    \item NeuroMorphoVis, a Blender add-on for building, visualizing and analyzing digital reconstructions of neuronal morphology skeletons by \cite{abdellah_neuromorphovis_2018} (\url{https://github.com/BlueBrain/NeuroMorphoVis})
\end{itemize}
