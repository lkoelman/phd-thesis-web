  abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly recognized as a promising technology in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences. There can be no argument that this technique is incredibly successful in image recognition with immediate applications in diagnostics including electrophysiology, radiology, or pathology, where we have access to massive amounts of annotated data. However, machine learning often performs poorly in prognosis, especially when dealing with sparse data. This is a field where classical physics-based simulation seems to remain irreplaceable. In this review, we identify areas in the biomedical sciences where machine learning and multiscale modeling can mutually benefit from one another: Machine learning can integrate physics-based knowledge in the form of governing equations, boundary conditions, or constraints to manage ill-posted problems and robustly handle sparse and noisy data; multiscale modeling can integrate machine learning to create surrogate models, identify system dynamics and parameters, analyze sensitivities, and quantify uncertainty to bridge the scales and understand the emergence of function. With a view towards applications in the life sciences, we discuss the state of the art of combining machine learning and multiscale modeling, identify applications and opportunities, raise open questions, and address potential challenges and limitations. We anticipate that it will stimulate discussion within the community of computational mechanics and reach out to other disciplines including mathematics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, systems biology, and precision medicine to join forces towards creating robust and efficient models for biological systems.},

  abstract = {Background: High frequency (\textasciitilde 130 Hz) deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic region is an established clinical therapy for the treatment of late stage Parkinson's disease (PD). Direct modulation of the hyperdirect pathway, defined as cortical layer V pyramidal neurons that send an axon collateral to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), has emerged as a possible component of the therapeutic mechanisms. However, numerous questions remain to be addressed on the basic biophysics of hyperdirect pathway stimulation.
Objective: Quantify action potential (AP) initiation, propagation, and cortical invasion in hyperdirect neurons during subthalamic stimulation.
Methods: We developed an anatomically and electrically detailed computational model of hyperdirect neuron stimulation with explicit representation of the stimulating electric field, axonal response, AP propagation, and synaptic transmission.
Results: We found robust AP propagation throughout the complex axonal arbor of the hyperdirect neuron. Even at therapeutic DBS frequencies, stimulation induced APs could reach all of the intracortical axon terminals with \textasciitilde 100\% fidelity. The functional result of this high frequency axonal driving of the thousands of synaptic connections made by each directly stimulated hyperdirect neuron is a profound synaptic suppression that would effectively disconnect the neuron from the cortical circuitry.
Conclusions: The synaptic suppression hypothesis integrates the fundamental biophysics of electrical stimulation, axonal transmission, and synaptic physiology to explain a generic mechanism of DBS. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This paper introduces a new graph-based recurrent retrieval approach that learns to retrieve reasoning paths over the Wikipedia graph to answer multi-hop open-domain questions. Our retriever model trains a recurrent neural network that learns to sequentially retrieve evidence paragraphs in the reasoning path by conditioning on the previously retrieved documents. Our reader model ranks the reasoning paths and extracts the answer span included in the best reasoning path. Experimental results show state-of-the-art results in three open-domain QA datasets, showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Notably, our method achieves significant improvement in HotpotQA, outperforming the previous best model by more than 14 points.},

  abstract = {Abnormally sustained beta-frequency synchronisation between the motor cortex and subthalamic nucleus (STN) is associated with motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is currently unclear whether STN neurons have a preference for beta-frequency input (12-35Hz), rather than cortical input at other frequencies, and how such a preference would arise following dopamine depletion. To address this question, we combined analysis of cortical and STN recordings from awake PD patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery with recordings of identified STN neurons in anaesthetised rats. In PD patients, we demonstrate that a subset of STN neurons are strongly and selectively sensitive to fluctuations of cortical beta oscillations over time, linearly increasing their phase-locking strength with respect to full range of instantaneous amplitude. In rats, we probed the frequency response of STN neurons more precisely, by recording spikes evoked by short bursts of cortical stimulation with variable frequency (4-40Hz) and constant amplitude.  In both healthy and dopamine-depleted animals, only beta-frequency stimulation selectively led to a progressive reduction in the variability of spike timing through the stimulation train.  We hypothesize, that abnormal activation of the indirect pathway, via dopamine depletion and/or cortical stimulation, could trigger an underlying sensitivity of the STN microcircuit to beta-frequency input.},

  abstract = {The modification of the discharge pattern of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons from single-spike activity to mixed burst-firing mode is one of the characteristics of parkinsonism in rat and primates. However, the mechanism of this process is not yet understood. Intrinsic firing patterns of STN neurons were examined in rat brain slices with intracellular and patch-clamp techniques. Almost half of the STN neurons that spontaneously discharged in the single-spike mode had the intrinsic property of switching to pure or mixed burst-firing mode when the membrane was hyperpolarized from -41.3 +/- 1.0 mV (range, -35 to -50 mV; n = 15) to -51.0 +/- 1.0 mV (range, -42 to -60 mV; n = 20). This switch was greatly facilitated by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors with 1S,3R-ACPD. Recurrent membrane oscillations underlying burst-firing mode were endogenous and Ca2+-dependent because they were largely reduced by nifedipine (3 microM), Ni2+ (40 microM), and BAPTA-AM (10-50 microM) at any potential tested, whereas TTX (1 microM) had no effect. In contrast, simultaneous application of TEA (1 mM) and apamin (0.2 microM) prolonged burst duration. Moreover, in response to intracellular stimulation at hyperpolarized potentials, a plateau potential with a voltage and ionic basis similar to those of spontaneous bursts was recorded in 82\% of the tested STN neurons, all of which displayed a low-threshold Ni2+-sensitive spike. We propose that recurrent membrane oscillations during bursts result from the sequential activation of T/R- and L-type Ca2+ currents, a Ca2+-activated inward current, and Ca2+-activated K+ currents.},

  abstract = {Subthalamic neurons drive basal ganglia output neurons in resting animals and relay cortical and thalamic activity to the same output neurons during movement. The first objective of this study was to determine the mechanisms underlying the spontaneous activity of subthalamic neurons in vitro and to gain insight into their resting discharge in vivo. The second objective was to determine the response of subthalamic neurons to depolarizing current injection and how intrinsic properties may shape their response to cortical and thalamic inputs during movement. Cell-attached and whole-cell recordings were made from subthalamic neurons in brain slices prepared from 3- to 4-week-old rats. The slow, rhythmic discharge of subthalamic neurons was resistant to blockade of excitatory synaptic transmission indicating that intrinsic currents underlie their spontaneous discharge. A persistent sodium current was the source of current during the depolarizing phase of the oscillation. A powerful afterhyperpolarization following each action potential was sufficient to terminate the depolarization. A long duration component of the spike afterhyperpolarization determined the period of the oscillation and was generated by an apamin-sensitive calcium-activated potassium current. Calcium entry responsible for that current was associated with action potentials. Subthalamic neurons exhibited a sigmoidal frequency-current relationship with the steeper portion starting at approximately 30-40 Hz. This property makes subthalamic neurons more sensitive to input at high firing rates associated with movement than at low rates associated with rest. We propose that the subthreshold persistent sodium current overcomes calcium activated potassium current which accumulates during high frequency firing and underlies the enhanced sensitivity to current {$>$}30 Hz.},

The electromyogram (EMG) of healthy humans demonstrates a tendency to rhythmic oscillations at around 40 Hz (the Piper rhythm) during strong voluntary contraction. Why motor units should discharge synchronously locked to such a high-frequency is unclear. We recorded whole scalp magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals simultaneously with surface EMG from 10 healthy subjects. In eight subjects, coherence and time domain analyses demonstrated correspondence between the MEG signal, originating near or in the hand region of the motor cortex, and the 35- to 60-Hz EMG recorded during repeated maximal isometric contractions of the contralateral forearm extensor muscles. Three of these subjects also showed similar coherence during isometric contractions of moderate strength and slow extension movements of the wrist. In addition, coherence and time domain analyses demonstrated correspondence between the MEG signals originating near or in the foot area of the motor cortex and EMG recorded during repeated maximal isometric contractions of the contralateral tibialis anterior muscle in the 30- to 60-Hz range. Most important, the frequency at the peak of the coherence spectrum differed between forearm and leg by as much as 10 Hz in the same subject. In contrast, the peak of the coherence spectrum occurred during sustained weak contraction in the 20- to 30-Hz range similarly for both forearm and foot. The lag between EMG and MEG activity in the leg was {$\sim$}15 ms greater than that seen in the forearm, an interval appropriate for conduction in fast pyramidal pathways. It is concluded that the Piper rhythm in muscle may be driven by a comparable oscillatory activity in the contralateral motor cortex. This cortical rhythmicity can be picked up in several types of movement and seems distinct from the 20- to 30-Hz rhythmicity recorded during weak sustained contractions.},

The analysis reveals a rich repertoire of states, including synchronous states in which neurons fire regularly; asynchronous states with stationary global activity and very irregular individual cell activity; and states in which the global activity oscillates but individual cells fire irregularly, typically at rates lower than the global oscillation frequency. The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale. In the slow oscillatory state, the network frequency depends mostly on the membrane time constant. Finite size effects in the asynchronous state are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established clinical treatment for a range of neurological disorders. Depending on the disease state of the patient, different anatomical structures such as the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM), the subthalamic nucleus or the globus pallidus are targeted for stimulation. However, the same electrode design is currently used in nearly all DBS applications, even though substantial morphological and anatomical differences exist between the various target nuclei. The fundamental goal of this study was to develop a theoretical understanding of the impact of changes in the DBS electrode contact geometry on the volume of tissue activated (VTA) during stimulation. Finite element models of the electrodes and surrounding medium were coupled to cable models of myelinated axons to predict the VTA as a function of stimulation parameter settings and electrode design. Clinical DBS electrodes have cylindrical contacts 1.27 mm in diameter (d) and 1.5 mm in height (h). Our results show that changes in contact height and diameter can substantially modulate the size and shape of the VTA, even when contact surface area is preserved. Electrode designs with a low aspect ratio (d/h) maximize the VTA by providing greater spread of the stimulation parallel to the electrode shaft without sacrificing lateral spread. The results of this study provide the foundation necessary to customize electrode design and VTA shape for specific anatomical targets, and an example is presented for the VIM. A range of opportunities exist to engineer DBS systems to maximize stimulation of the target area while minimizing stimulation of non-target areas. Therefore, it may be possible to improve therapeutic benefit and minimize side effects from DBS with the design of target-specific electrodes.},

  abstract = {Prevalence and temporal dynamics of transient oscillations in the beta frequency band (15-35 Hz), referred to as beta bursts, are correlated with motor performance and tactile perception. Disturbance of these activities is a candidate mechanism for motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD), where the excessively long bursts correlate with symptom severity and are reduced by pharmacological and surgical treatments. To date, characterization of beta bursts in PD has been limited to the local field potentials in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and cortical EEG. Here, we describe the changes that take place in spiking activity across the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, providing a unique insight into the network dynamics of these transient oscillations. Firstly, we demonstrate that rhythmic subthalamic spiking activity emerges at a fixed phase relationship with respect to cortical beta bursts in PD patients. Using multichannel recordings of ensembles of neurons in the 6-OHDA rat model of PD, we then dissect the beta burst dynamics across the sensorimotor cortex and several basal ganglia structures: striatum (Str), globus pallidus externus (GPe) and STN. Each subcortical structure exhibits enhanced rhythmic activity in the beta band locked to the onset of cortical beta bursts and longer cortical bursts lead to stronger subcortical rhythmicity. Crucially, enhanced subcortical rhythmic activity emerges at a fixed phase relationship with respect to the motor cortex, comparable to the relationship observed in PD patients. Striatal beta bursts terminate prior to the recruitment of those in the STN and GPe, suggesting that while they could play an important role in establishing synchrony in the beta band, they do not extensively contribute to its maintenance in other basal ganglia structures. Critically, changes in cortico-subcortical phase coupling precede the onset of a cortical beta burst, supporting the hypothesis that phase alignment across the cortico-basal ganglia network could recruit these structures into synchronous network oscillations. We provide a powerful approach that not only examines pathophysiology of PD across the motor circuit, but also offer insights that could aid in the design of novel neuromodulation strategies to manipulate the state of the motor system before pathological activities emerge.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems can be programmed with thousands of different stimulation parameter combinations (e.g. electrode contact(s), voltage, pulse width, frequency). Our goal was to develop novel computational tools to characterize the effects of stimulation parameter adjustment for DBS.
APPROACH: The volume of tissue activated (VTA) represents a metric used to estimate the spatial extent of DBS for a given parameter setting. Traditional methods for calculating the VTA rely on activation function (AF)-based approaches and tend to overestimate the neural response when stimulation is applied through multiple electrode contacts. Therefore, we created a new method for VTA calculation that relied on artificial neural networks (ANNs).
MAIN RESULTS: The ANN-based predictor provides more accurate descriptions of the spatial spread of activation compared to AF-based approaches for monopolar stimulation. In addition, the ANN was able to accurately estimate the VTA in response to multi-contact electrode configurations.
SIGNIFICANCE: The ANN-based approach may represent a useful method for fast computation of the VTA in situations with limited computational resources, such as a clinical DBS programming application on a tablet computer.},

However, in parkinsonian mice we found that corticoSTN transmission strength had diminished by 50\%\textendash 75\% through loss of axo-dendritic and axo-spinous synapses, was incapable of long-term potentiation, and less effectively patterned STN activity. Optogenetic, chemogenetic, genetic, and pharmacological interrogation suggested that downregulation of cortico-STN transmission in PD mice was triggered by increased striato-pallidal transmission, leading to disinhibition of the STN and increased activation of STN NMDA receptors. Knockdown of STN NMDA receptors, which also suppresses proliferation of GABAergic pallido-STN inputs in PD mice, reduced loss of cortico-STN transmission and patterning and improved motor function. Together, the data suggest that loss of dopamine triggers a maladaptive shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition in the STN, which contributes to parkinsonian activity and motor dysfunction.},

The stability of diluted vaccines was determined by assay in cell cultures subjected to 0 to 37 C for 0 to 90 minutes. Optimum holding temperatures for MD vaccine virus survival varied with the specific diluents employed. Some diluents afforded greatest survival when dilution was at 0 C and held at 0 C, while others performed best when dilution was at 25 C followed by cooling and holding at 0 C. Diluents which allowed greatest survival when tested at 37 C also performed well under other temperature regimes. Spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate and various buffering compounds were added to commercial diluents used for diluting MD vaccine. Additives producing osmolality of 745 mOsm/kg and higher markedly reduced vaccine virus survival. The adverse effects of high osmotic pressure were accentuated by extended holding time, elevated incubation temperature, and physical manipulations including mechanical mixing or expressing through a syringe and needle. Satisfactory MD vaccine virus survival was afforded by a commercial diluent especially formulated to accommodate the pH osmolality changes produced by adding spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate.},

  abstract = {Individual axons that form the hyperdirect pathway in Macaca fascicularis were visualized following microiontophoretic injections of biotinylated dextran amine in layer V of the primary motor cortex (M1). Twenty-eight singly labeled axons were reconstructed in 3D from serial sections. The M1 innervation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) arises essentially from collaterals of long-ranged corticofugal axons en route to lower brainstem regions. Typically, after leaving M1, these large caliber axons (2\textendash 3 \textmu m) enter the internal capsule and travel between caudate nucleus and putamen without providing any collateral to the striatum. More ventrally, they emit a thin collateral (0.5\textendash 1.5 \textmu m) that runs lateromedially within the dorsal region of the STN, providing boutons en passant in the sensorimotor territory of the nucleus. In some cases, the medial tip of the collateral enters the lenticular fasciculus dorsally and yields a few beaded axonal branches in the zona incerta. In other cases, the collateral runs caudally and innervates the ventrolateral region of the red nucleus where large axon varicosities (up to 1.7 \textmu m in diameter) are observed, many displaying perisomatic arrangements. Our ultrastructural analysis reveals a high synaptic incidence (141\%) of cortical VGluT1-immunoreactive axon varicosities on distal dendrites of STN neurons, and on various afferent axons. Our single-axon reconstructions demonstrate that the so-called hyperdirect pathway derives essentially from collaterals of long-ranged corticofugal axons that are rarely exclusively devoted to the STN, as they also innervate the red nucleus and/or the zona incerta.},

  abstract = {We explore the influence of synaptic location and form on the behavior of networks of coupled cortical oscillators. First, we develop a model of two coupled somatic oscillators that includes passive dendritic cables. Using a phase model approach, we show that the synchronous solution can change from a stable solution to an unstable one as the cable lengthens and the synaptic position moves further from the soma. We confirm this prediction using a system of coupled compartmental models. We also demonstrate that when the synchronous solution becomes unstable, a bifurcation occurs and a pair of asynchronous stable solutions appear, causing a phase lag between the cells in the system. Then using a variety of coupling functions and different synaptic positions, we show that distal connections and broad synaptic time courses encourage phase lags that can be reduced, eliminated, or enhanced by the presence of active currents in the dendrite. This mechanism may appear in neural systems where proximal connections could be used to encourage synchrony, and distal connections and broad synaptic time courses could be used to produce phase lags that can be modulated by active currents.},

  abstract = {The inhibitory circuits of the striatum are known to be critical for motor function, yet their contributions to Parkinsonian motor deficits are not clear. Altered firing in the globus pallidus suggests that striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the direct (D1 MSN) and indirect pathway (D2 MSN) are imbalanced during dopamine depletion. Both MSN classes receive inhibitory input from each other and from inhibitory interneurons within the striatum, specifically the fast-spiking interneurons (FSI). To investigate the role of inhibition in maintaining striatal balance, we developed a biologically-realistic striatal network model consisting of multicompartmental neuron models: 500 D1 MSNs, 500 D2 MSNs and 49 FSIs. The D1 and D2 MSN models are differentiated based on published experiments of individual channel modulations by dopamine, with D2 MSNs being more excitable than D1 MSNs. Despite this difference in response to current injection, in the network D1 and D2 MSNs fire at similar frequencies in response to excitatory synaptic input. Simulations further reveal that inhibition from FSIs connected by gap junctions is critical to produce balanced firing. Although gap junctions produce only a small increase in synchronization between FSIs, removing these connections resulted in significant firing differences between D1 and D2 MSNs, and balanced firing was restored by providing synchronized cortical input to the FSIs. Together these findings suggest that desynchronization of FSI firing is sufficient to alter balanced firing between D1 and D2 MSNs.},

  abstract = {Salient stimuli redirect attention and suppress ongoing motor activity. This attentional shift is thought to rely upon thalamic signals to the striatum to shift cortically driven action selection, but the network mechanisms underlying this interaction are unclear. Using a brain slice preparation that preserved cortico- and thalamostriatal connectivity, it was found that activation of thalamostriatal axons in a way that mimicked the response to salient stimuli induced a burst of spikes in striatal cholinergic interneurons that was followed by a pause lasting more than half a second. This patterned interneuron activity triggered a transient, presynaptic suppression of cortical input to both major classes of principal medium spiny neuron (MSN) that gave way to a prolonged enhancement of postsynaptic responsiveness in striatopallidal MSNs controlling motor suppression. This differential regulation of the corticostriatal circuitry provides a neural substrate for attentional shifts and cessation of ongoing motor activity with the appearance of salient environmental stimuli.},

  abstract = {High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or internal segment of the globus pallidus is a clinically successful treatment for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanisms by which HFS alleviates these symptoms are not understood. Whereas initial studies focused on HFS-induced changes in neuronal firing rates, recent studies suggest that changes in patterns of neuronal activity may correlate with symptom alleviation. We hypothesized that effective STN HFS reduces the disorder of neuronal firing patterns in the basal ganglia thalamic circuit, minimizing the pathological activity associated with parkinsonism. Stimulating leads were implanted in the STN of two rhesus monkeys rendered parkinsonian by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Action potentials were recorded from neurons of the internal and external globus pallidus and the motor thalamus (ventralis anterior, ventralis lateralis pars oralis, and ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis) during HFS that reduced motor symptoms and during clinically ineffective low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Firing pattern entropy was calculated from the recorded spike times to quantify the disorder of the neuronal activity. The firing pattern entropy of neurons within each region of the pallidum and motor thalamus decreased in response to HFS ( n {$\geq$} 18 and P {$\leq$} 0.02 in each region), whereas firing rate changes were specific to pallidal neurons only. In response to LFS, firing rates were unchanged, but firing pattern entropy increased throughout the circuit ( n {$\geq$} 24 and P {$\leq$} 10
              -4
              in each region). These data suggest that the clinical effectiveness of HFS is correlated with, and potentially mediated by, a regularization of the pattern of neuronal activity throughout the basal ganglia thalamic circuit.},

We conducted a preclinical study of electrical interference in the primary motor cortex using a chronic MPTP primate model in which dopamine depletion was progressive and regularly documented using 18F-DOPA positron tomography. High-frequency motor cortex stimulation significantly reduced akinesia and bradykinesia. This behavioral benefit was associated with an increased metabolic activity in the supplementary motor area as assessed with 18-F-deoxyglucose PET, a normalization of mean firing rate in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and a reduction of synchronized oscillatory neuronal activities in these two structures. Motor cortex stimulation is a simple and safe procedure to modulate subthalamo-pallido-cortical loop and alleviate parkinsonian symptoms without requiring deep brain stereotactic surgery.},

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus bibliographic, and Google Scholar databases were searched. Relevant controlled clinical trials published between January 1985 and October 2007 were extracted, reviewed, and validated according to the study protocol. The outcome of interest was the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). We calculated the effect size for the included studies. Sensitivity analysis was performed to further assess factors that may change the results. Ten randomized, controlled clinical trials were included in the meta-analysis. Pooling of the results from these trials yielded an effect size of -0.58 in UPDRS for high-frequency rTMS studies and no significant effects for low-frequency rTMS studies. The benefit of high-frequency rTMS on motor signs in PD was confirmed by the meta-analysis. Lower frequency rTMS had little effect on motor signs in PD.},

  abstract = {A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to quantify the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for the treatment of motor dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Prospective studies which evaluated the effects of either TMS (12 studies) or ECT (five studies) on motor function in PD using the motor subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) for TMS studies and any continuous measures of motor function in PD for ECT studies were included. The pooled effect size (standardised mean difference between pre-treatment versus post-treatment means) from a random effects model was 0.62 (95\% confidence interval: 0.38, 0.85) for TMS treatment and 1.68 (0.79, 2.56) for ECT treatment, and from a fixed effects model was 0.59 (0.39, 0.78) for TMS treatment and 1.55 (1.07, 2.03) for ECT treatment. TMS, across applied stimulation sites and parameters, can exert a significant, albeit modest, positive effect on the motor function of patients with PD. ECT also may exert a significant effect on motor function in PD patients.},

  abstract = {A coherent set of models is presented that provide novel and testable predictions about the functional role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the basal ganglia. The STN is emerging as an important target for novel therapeutic strategies for the alleviation of Parkinsonian type symptoms [Lancet 345 (1995) 91; Science 249 (1990) 1436]. Computational and mathematical models based on the properties of the STN and its interactions are reviewed. These models focus on core anatomical and physiological data that span many levels. By assessing models of anatomy, dynamic network models, and a detailed model of a recent pharmacological experiment, we can expose the primary modes of STN function and highlight their underlying properties. We show that the presence of functional interactions between STN projection neurons is critical in defining its behaviour and how it interacts with other basal ganglia nuclei. Pulses or switch-like activity patterns emerge in the models as a consequence of these local interactions. Furthermore, the models demonstrate that this behaviour can break down under abnormal conditions resulting in low frequency bursting oscillations. Such oscillations may play a role in symptoms of Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {Brains need to predict how the body reacts to motor commands. It is an open question how networks of spiking neurons can learn to reproduce the non-linear body dynamics caused by motor commands, using local, online and stable learning rules. Here, we present a supervised learning scheme for the feedforward and recurrent connections in a network of heterogeneous spiking neurons. The error in the output is fed back through fixed random connections with a negative gain, causing the network to follow the desired dynamics, while an online and local rule changes the weights. The rule for Feedback-based Online Local Learning Of Weights (FOLLOW) is local in the sense that weight changes depend on the presynaptic activity and the error signal projected onto the postsynaptic neuron. We provide examples of learning linear, non-linear and chaotic dynamics, as well as the dynamics of a two-link arm. Using the Lyapunov method, and under reasonable assumptions and approximations, we show that FOLLOW learning is stable uniformly, with the error going to zero asymptotically.},

  abstract = {In Parkinson's disease (PD), dopamine depletion alters neuronal activity in the direct and indirect pathways and leads to increased synchrony in the basal ganglia network. However, the origins of these changes remain elusive. Because GABAergic interneurons regulate activity of projection neurons and promote neuronal synchrony, we recorded from pairs of striatal fast-spiking (FS) interneurons and direct- or indirect-pathway MSNs after dopamine depletion with 6-OHDA. Synaptic properties of FS-MSN connections remained similar, yet within 3 days of dopamine depletion, individual FS cells doubled their connectivity to indirect-pathway MSNs, whereas connections to direct-pathway MSNs remained unchanged. A model of the striatal microcircuit revealed that such increases in FS innervation were effective at enhancing synchrony within targeted cell populations. These data suggest that after dopamine depletion, rapid target-specific microcircuit organization in the striatum may lead to increased synchrony of indirect-pathway MSNs that contributes to pathological network oscillations and motor symptoms of PD.},

  abstract = {Despite rapid advances in machine learning tools, the majority of neural decoding approaches still use traditional methods. Improving the performance of neural decoding algorithms allows us to better understand the information contained in a neural population, and can help advance engineering applications such as brain machine interfaces. Here, we apply modern machine learning techniques, including neural networks and gradient boosting, to decode from spiking activity in 1) motor cortex, 2) somatosensory cortex, and 3) hippocampus. We compare the predictive ability of these modern methods with traditional decoding methods such as Wiener and Kalman filters. Modern methods, in particular neural networks and ensembles, significantly outperformed the traditional approaches. For instance, for all of the three brain areas, an LSTM decoder explained over 40\% of the unexplained variance from a Wiener filter. These results suggest that modern machine learning techniques should become the standard methodology for neural decoding. We provide a tutorial and code to facilitate wider implementation of these methods.},

  abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

  abstract = {Distinct activity patterns in subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons are observed during normal voluntary movement and abnormal movement in Parkinson's disease (PD). To determine how such patterns of activity are regulated by small conductance potassium (SK)/calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels and voltage-gated calcium (Cav) channels, STN neurons were recorded in the perforated patch configuration in slices, [which were prepared from postnatal day 16 (P16)-P30 rats and held at 37 degrees C] and then treated with the SK KCa channel antagonist apamin or the SK KCa channel agonist 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone or the Cav channel antagonists w-omega-conotoxin GVIA (Cav2.2-selective) or nifedipine (Cav1.2-1.3-selective) [corrected]. In other experiments, fura-2 was introduced as an indicator of intracellular calcium dynamics. A component of the current underlying single-spike afterhyperpolarization was sensitive to apamin, phase-locked to calcium entry via Cav2.2 channels, and necessary for precise, autonomous, single-spike oscillation. SK KCa/Cav2.2 channel coupling did not underlie spike-frequency adaptation but limited activity in response to current injection by encoding the accumulation of intracellular calcium, maintained the characteristic sigmoidal frequency-intensity relationship and generated a post-train afterhyperpolarization. In addition, SK KCa channels terminated rebound burst activity more effectively in neurons with short-duration bursts ({$<$}100 msec) than neurons with long-duration bursts ({$>$}100 msec), presumably through their activation by Cav3 channels. Cav1.2-1.3 channels were not strongly coupled to SK KCa channels and therefore supported secondary range and long-duration rebound burst firing.

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers\textemdash 8\texttimes{} deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.},

Rather than a single unifying mechanism, DBS likely acts via several, nonexclusive mechanisms including local and network-wide electrical and neurochemical effects of stimulation, modulation of oscillatory activity, synaptic plasticity, and, potentially, neuroprotection and neurogenesis. These different mechanisms vary in importance depending on the condition being treated and the target being stimulated. Here we review each of these in turn and illustrate how an understanding of these mechanisms is inspiring next-generation approaches to DBS.},

  abstract = {In addition to their well-known role in skeletal movements, the basal ganglia control saccadic eye movements (saccades) by means of their connection to the superior colliculus (SC). The SC receives convergent inputs from cerebral cortical areas and the basal ganglia. To make a saccade to an object purposefully, appropriate signals must be selected out of the cortical inputs, in which the basal ganglia play a crucial role. This is done by the sustained inhibitory input from the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) to the SC. This inhibition can be removed by another inhibition from the caudate nucleus (CD) to the SNr, which results in a disinhibition of the SC. The basal ganglia have another mechanism, involving the external segment of the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus, with which the SNr-SC inhibition can further be enhanced. The sensorimotor signals carried by the basal ganglia neurons are strongly modulated depending on the behavioral context, which reflects working memory, expectation, and attention. Expectation of reward is a critical determinant in that the saccade that has been rewarded is facilitated subsequently. The interaction between cortical and dopaminergic inputs to CD neurons may underlie the behavioral adaptation toward purposeful saccades.},

  abstract = {The increasing complexity of network models poses a growing computational burden. At the same time, computational neuroscientists are finding it easier to access parallel hardware, such as multiprocessor personal computers, workstation clusters, and massively parallel supercomputers. The practical question is how to move a working network model from a single processor to parallel hardware. Here we show how to make this transition for models implemented with NEURON, in such a way that the final result will run and produce numerically identical results on either serial or parallel hardware. This allows users to develop and debug models on readily available local resources, then run their code without modification on a parallel supercomputer.},

  abstract = {Much of studies on neural computation are based on network models of static neurons that produce analog output, despite the fact that information processing in the brain is predominantly carried out by dynamic neurons that produce discrete pulses called spikes. Research in spike-based computation has been impeded by the lack of efficient supervised learning algorithm for spiking networks. Here, we present a gradient descent method for optimizing spiking network models by introducing a differentiable formulation of spiking networks and deriving the exact gradient calculation. For demonstration, we trained recurrent spiking networks on two dynamic tasks: one that requires optimizing fast (\textasciitilde millisecond) spike-based interactions for efficient encoding of information, and a delayed memory XOR task over extended duration (\textasciitilde second). The results show that our method indeed optimizes the spiking network dynamics on the time scale of individual spikes as well as behavioral time scales. In conclusion, our result offers a general purpose supervised learning algorithm for spiking neural networks, thus advancing further investigations on spike-based computation.},

Our method for transforming deep artificial neural networks into spiking networks is scalable and works with a wide range of neural nonlinearities. We achieve these results by softening the neural response function, such that its derivative remains bounded, and by training the network with noise to provide robustness against the variability introduced by spikes. Our analysis shows that implementations of these networks on neuromorphic hardware will be many times more power-efficient than the equivalent non-spiking networks on traditional hardware.},

  abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionally powerful class of models, but are still limited by the lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data in a computationally and parameter efficient manner. In this work we introduce a new learnable module, the Spatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability to actively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself, without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the use of spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation, scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and for a number of classes of transformations.},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus (GPi) is a major treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. The effects of this intervention on electrical activity patterns in targets of GPi output, specifically in the thalamus, are poorly understood. The experiments described here examined these effects using electrophysiological recordings in two Rhesus monkeys rendered moderately parkinsonian through treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), after sampling control data in the same animals. Analysis of spontaneous spiking activity of neurons in the basal ganglia-receiving areas of the ventral thalamus showed that MPTP-induced parkinsonism is associated with a reduction of firing rates of segments of the data that contained neither bursts nor decelerations, and with increased burst firing. Spectral analyses revealed an increase of power in the 3- to 13-Hz band and a reduction in the {$\gamma$}-range in the spiking activity of these neurons. Electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral motor territory of GPi with macroelectrodes, mimicking deep brain stimulation in parkinsonian patients (bipolar electrodes, 0.5 mm intercontact distance, biphasic stimuli, 120 Hz, 100 {$\mu$}s/phase, 200 {$\mu$}A), had antiparkinsonian effects. The stimulation markedly reduced oscillations in thalamic firing in the 13- to 30-Hz range and uncoupled the spiking activity of recorded neurons from simultaneously recorded local field potential (LFP) activity. These results confirm that oscillatory and nonoscillatory characteristics of spontaneous activity in the basal ganglia receiving ventral thalamus are altered in MPTP-induced parkinsonism. Electrical stimulation of GPi did not entrain thalamic activity but changed oscillatory activity in the ventral thalamus and altered the relationship between spikes and simultaneously recorded LFPs.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

  abstract = {Abstract
          The aim of this study was to understand the relative role of autonomous oscillations and patterning by exogenous oscillatory inputs in the generation of pathological oscillatory activity within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) - external globus pallidus (GPe) network in Parkinson's disease. A biophysically detailed model that accounts for the integration of synaptic currents and their interaction with intrinsic membrane currents in dendritic structures within the STN and GPe was developed. The model was used to investigate the development of beta-band synchrony and bursting within the STN-GPe network by changing the balance of excitation and inhibition in both nuclei, and by adding exogenous oscillatory inputs with varying phase relationships through the hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic and indirect striato-pallidal pathways. The model showed an intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations that was manifest in weak autonomously generated oscillations within the STN-GPe network and in selective amplification of exogenous beta-band synaptic inputs near the network's endogenous oscillation frequency. The resonant oscillation frequency was determined by the net level of excitatory drive in the loop. Intrinsically generated oscillations were too weak to support a pacemaker role for the STN-GPe network, however, they were considerably amplified by sparse cortical beta inputs when their frequency range overlapped and were further amplified by striatal beta inputs that promoted anti-phase firing of the cortex and GPe, resulting in maximum transient inhibition of STN neurons. The model elucidates a mechanism of cortical patterning of the STN-GPe network through feedback inhibition whereby intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations can lead to phase locked spiking under parkinsonian conditions. These results point to resonance of endogenous oscillations with exogenous patterning of the STN-GPe network as a mechanism of pathological synchronization, and a role for the pallido-striatal feedback loop in amplifying beta oscillations.
          
            Author summary
            Exaggerated beta-frequency neuronal synchrony is observed throughout the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease and is reduced with medication and during deep brain stimulation. The power of beta-band oscillations is increasingly used as a biomarker to guide antiparkinsonian therapies. Despite their importance as a clinical target, the mechanisms by which pathological beta-band oscillations are generated are not yet clearly understood. In vitro electrophysiological recordings support a theory of enhanced phase locking of the reciprocally connected subthalamo-pallidal network to beta-band cortical inputs but this has not yet been clearly demonstrated in a model. We present a new model of the subthalamo-pallidal network consisting of biophysically detailed cell models that captures the interaction between synaptic and intrinsic currents in dendritic structures. The model shows how phase locking of subthalamic and pallidal neurons and exaggerated bursting in subthalamic neurons can arise from the interaction of these currents when the balance of excitation and inhibition is changed and how phase locking is amplified under specific phase relationships between cortical and striatal beta inputs.},

Tremors were recorded by an accelerometer to determine amplitude and frequency. A postural tremor was present in 92\% and a resting tremor in 76\%. The amplitude of postural tremor was greater than resting tremor in 50\%, the same in 25\%, and less in 25\%. The average tremor frequency of resting and postural tremor was not significantly different. Carbidopa/levodopa reduced testing tremor in 58\% and postural tremor in 46\% of patients. The dopamine agonist naxoglide (PHNO) reduced resting tremor in 77\% and postural tremor in 70\% of patients. Postural tremor was not worsened by either drug. It is concluded that tremors in both the resting and postural positions are an integral part of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and that both tremors have a similar frequency and pharmacological responsiveness in the early phases of the disease.},

While regionlevel models often feature dense pairwise connectivity, pixel-level models are considerably larger and have only permitted sparse graph structures. In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and labeling accuracy.},

  abstract = {This article presents, for the first time, a practical method for the direct quantification of frequency-specific synchronization (i.e., transient phase-locking) between two neuroelectric signals. The motivation for its development is to be able to examine the role of neural synchronies as a putative mechanism for long-range neural integration during cognitive tasks. The method, called phase-locking statistics (PLS), measures the significance of the phase covariance between two signals with a reasonable time-resolution (Ï½100 ms). Unlike the more traditional method of spectral coherence, PLS separates the phase and amplitude components and can be directly interpreted in the framework of neural integration. To validate synchrony values against background fluctuations, PLS uses surrogate data and thus makes no a priori assumptions on the nature of the experimental data. We also apply PLS to investigate intracortical recordings from an epileptic patient performing a visual discrimination task. We find large-scale synchronies in the gamma band (45 Hz), e.g., between hippocampus and frontal gyrus, and local synchronies, within a limbic region, a few cm apart. We argue that whereas long-scale effects do reflect cognitive processing, short-scale synchronies are likely to be due to volume conduction. We discuss ways to separate such conduction effects from true signal synchrony. Hum Brain Mapping 8:194\textendash 208, 1999. à¯  1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong Beta-band oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. According to the mainstream theory, this synchrony is mediated by a dopamine deficit within the striatum creating a functional imbalance between the D1-expressing medium spiny neurons, which project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus, and D2-expressing one, which target its external segment, and ultimately leads to oscillatory activity. However, anatomical evidence gathered in rodents and primates has shown that striatal neurons are for the most part not organized into independent populations differentially targeting the two segments of the globus pallidus, nor alternatively expressing D1 or D2 receptors, thus calling for an alternative mechanism through which the lack of dopamine may cause oscillations. Here we adopt a computational approach in which we investigate a model whose parameters are fit to an extensive set of anatomical and physiological constraints from non-human primates, including axonal transmission delays gathered from eight experimental studies. Investigating the lack of dopamine in this model revealed that in the absence of
segregated pathways, Beta-band oscillations emerge as a consequence of the extra-striate dopaminergic receptors reduced activity. These oscillations are caused by synchronous activity within the external globus pallidus-subthalamic nucleus loop, and their frequency are modulated by the transmission delays between these nuclei. Our model delivers a parsimonious explanation of oscillations that does not require any external driving influence from cortex, nor specific medium spiny neuron properties.},

  abstract = {In Parkinson's disease, the enhanced beta rhythm is closely associated with akinesia/bradykinesia and rigidity. An increase in beta oscillations (12\textendash 35 Hz) within the basal ganglia (BG) nuclei does not proliferate throughout the cortico-basal ganglia loop in uniform fashion; rather it can be subdivided into two distinct frequency bands, i.e. the lower beta (12\textendash 20 Hz) and upper beta (21\textendash 35 Hz). A computational model of the excitatory and inhibitory neural network that focuses on the population properties is proposed to explore the mechanism underlying the pathological beta oscillations. Simulation results show several findings. The upper beta frequency in the BG originates from a high frequency cortical beta, while the emergence of exaggerated lower beta frequency in the BG depends greatly on the enhanced excitation of a reciprocal network consisting of the globus pallidus externus (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). There is also a transition mechanism between the upper and lower beta oscillatory activities, and we explore the impact of self-inhibition within the GPe on the relationship between the upper beta and lower beta oscillations. It is shown that increased self-inhibition within the GPe contributes to increased upper beta oscillations driven by the cortical rhythm, while decrease in the self-inhibition within the GPe facilitates an enhancement of the lower beta oscillations induced by the increased excitability of the BG. This work provides an analysis for understanding the mechanism underlying pathological synchronization in neurological diseases.},

As a surgical tool, DBS can directly measure pathological brain activity and can deliver adjustable stimulation for therapeutic effect in neurological and psychiatric disorders correlated with dysfunctional circuitry. The development of DBS has opened new opportunities to access and interrogate malfunctioning brain circuits and to test the therapeutic potential of regulating the output of these circuits in a broad range of disorders. Despite the success and rapid adoption of DBS, crucial questions remain, including which brain areas should be targeted and in which patients. This Review considers how DBS has facilitated advances in our understanding of how circuit malfunction can lead to brain disorders and outlines the key unmet challenges and future directions in the DBS field. Determining the next steps in DBS science will help to define the future role of this technology in the development of novel therapeutics for the most challenging disorders affecting the human brain.},

  abstract = {1. The interaction between inhibitory interneurons and cortical pyramidal neurons was studied by use of computer simulations to test whether inhibitory interneurons could assist in phase-locking postsynaptic cells. Two models were used: a simplified model, which included only 3 membrane channels, and a detailed 11-channel model. 2. The 11-channel model included most of the ion channels known to be present in neocortical pyramidal neurons as well as calcium diffusion and other membrane mechanisms. The kinetics for the channels were obtained from voltage-clamp studies in a variety of preparations. The parameters were then adjusted to produce repetitive bursting similar to that seen in some cortical pyramidal cells entrained during visual stimulation. 3. Phase-locking to a train of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) located on or near the soma was observed in the 3-channel model cell subjected to random synaptic bombardment. In the 11-channel model, phase-locking due to multiple IPSPs was compared with phase-locking due to multiple excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Phase-locking began to occur when 20\% of the IPSPs (20/100) or 40\% of the EPSPs (4,000/10,000) were synchronized. The exact percentages differed with different 11-channel models, but either EPSPs or IPSPs would generally produce entrainment with approximately 40\% synchronization. Thus 40 inhibitory boutons had an effect equivalent to 4,000 excitatory boutons in producing phase-locking. 4. Phase-locking with IPSPs in these models was possible because the IPSPs could cause either an increase or a decrease in firing rate over a limited range. The IPSPs served a modulatory role, increasing the rate of firing in some cases and decreasing it in others, depending on the state of the cell. 5. We examined frequency entrainment by IPSPs. In the 3-channel model, frequency entrainment of a postsynaptic cell was observed with a rapid train of strong (20-100 nS), brief, compound IPSPs. A 40-Hz compound IPSP train of 60 nS entrained cells having initial firing rates between 32 and 47 Hz. Below this range, cells could be partially entrained. Above the range, entrainment would fail. Frequency entrainment in the 3-channel model generally occurred on the first cycle after onset of the IPSPs. 6. Phase-locking and frequency entrainment were less robust in the 11-channel model. This was partly because bursts rather than individual spikes were being entrained. A 40-Hz, 90-nS compound IPSP train entrained a model cell upward from 34 Hz. Downward frequency entrainment also occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The subthalamic nucleus (STN), a major component of the basal ganglia, exerts an excitatory influence on the output structures of this system i.e., the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and the internal segment of the globus pallidus. High-frequency stimulation of the STN is a method currently used to treat parkinsonian symptoms. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of STN high-frequency stimulation on the activity of SNR neurons and to investigate its impact on the transfer of information between the cerebral cortex and the SNR. During STN high-frequency stimulation, the activity of SNR cells was decreased at low-intensity stimulation, whereas it was increased at a higher intensity. The decrease in the discharge of SNR cells likely results from the activation of a GABAergic transmission in the SNR because this effect was blocked by local application of bicuculline. The increased activity likely results from the activation of the glutamatergic subthalamonigral projection because the latency of the evoked excitations was consistent with the conduction time of the subthalamonigral neurons. Finally, during STN high-frequency stimulation, the transmission of cortical information along the direct trans-striatal pathway was preserved, whereas the functionality of the trans-subthalamic pathways was partly preserved or completely blocked depending on the stimulation intensity. The present data indicate that STN high-frequency stimulation influences the activity of SNR cells through activation of their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic afferent pathways as well as antidromic activation of the projection neurons.},

  abstract = {Introduction\hspace{0.6em} Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) is beneficial when delivered at a high frequency. However, the effects of current amplitude and pulse width on subthalamic neuronal activity during highfrequency stimulation have not been investigated.
Methods\hspace{0.6em} In 20 patients with Parkinson's disease each undergoing subthalamic DBS, we recorded single-unit subthalamic activity using one microelectrode, while a separate microelectrode was used to deliver 5\textendash 10\,s trains of stimulation at 100\,Hz using varying current amplitudes and pulse widths (44 neurons investigated).
Results\hspace{0.6em} Analysis of variance tests confirmed significant (p{$<$}0.001) main effects of both current amplitude and pulse width on subthalamic neuronal firing during stimulation and on poststimulus inhibitory silent periods. Prolonged silent periods were often followed by postinhibitory rebound burst excitations. Additionally, a significant (p{$<$}0.0001) correlation was found between neuronal firing and total electrical energy delivered (TEED). With TEED values{$\leq$}31.2 \textmu J/s (associated with DBS parameters of {$\leq$}2.0\,mA, 130\,Hz stimulation frequency and 60 \textmu s pulse width, assuming 1\,k{$\Omega$} impedance), neuronal firing was sustained at a rate of 32.4\%{$\pm$}3.3\% (mean{$\pm$}SE), while with values{$>$}31.2 \textmu J/s, neurons fired at only 4.3\%{$\pm$}1.2\%.

  abstract = {Measures of spike train synchrony have proven a valuable tool in both experimental and computational neuroscience. Particularly useful are time-resolved methods such as the ISI- and the SPIKE-distance, which have already been applied in various bivariate and multivariate contexts. Recently, SPIKE-Synchronization was proposed as another time-resolved synchronization measure. It is based on Event-Synchronization and has a very intuitive interpretation. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of these three synchronization measures. For example, we were able to obtain analytic expressions for the expectation values of the ISI-distance and SPIKE-Synchronization for Poisson spike trains. For the SPIKE-distance we present an empirical formula deduced from numerical evaluations. These expectation values are crucial for interpreting the synchronization of spike trains measured in experiments or numerical simulations, as they represent the point of reference for fully randomized spike trains.},

  abstract = {How the motor-related cortical areas modulate the activity of the output nuclei of the basal ganglia is an important issue for understanding the mechanisms of motor control by the basal ganglia. In the present study, by using awake monkeys, the polysynaptic effects of electrical stimulation in the forelimb regions of the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices on the activity of globus pallidus (GP) neurons, especially mediated by the subthalamic nucleus (STN), have been characterized. Cortical stimulation induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by an inhibition and a late excitation in neurons of both the external and internal segments of the GP. It also induced an early, short-latency excitation followed by a late excitation and an inhibition in STN neurons. The early excitation in STN neurons preceded that in GP neurons. Blockade of STN neuronal activity by muscimol (GABAA receptor agonist) injection resulted in abolishment of both the early and late excitations evoked in GP neurons by cortical stimulation. At the same time, the spontaneous discharge rate of GP neurons decreased, pauses between the groups of spikes of GP neurons became prominent, and the firing pattern became regular. Injection of ({$\pm$})-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) [N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist], but not 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium [NBQX (non-NMDA receptor antagonist)], into the STN attenuated the early and late excitations in GP neurons, suggesting that cortico-subthalamic transmission is mediated mainly by NMDA receptors. Interference with the pallido-subthalamic transmission by bicuculline (GABAA receptor antagonist) injection into the STN made the inhibition distinct without affecting the early excitation. The present results indicate that the cortico-subthalamo-pallidal pathway conveys powerful excitatory effects from the motor-related cortical areas to the GP with shorter conduction time than the effects conveyed through the striatum.},

  month = apr,
  abstract = {Cannabinoid receptors, located throughout the body, are part of the Endocannabinoid system which is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory.
Cannabinoid receptors are of a class of cell membrane receptors under the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. As is typical of G protein-coupled receptors, the cannabinoid receptors contain seven transmembrane spanning domains. Cannabinoid receptors are activated by three major groups of ligands: endocannabinoids, produced by the mammillary body; plant cannabinoids (such as Cannabidiol, produced by the cannabis plant); and synthetic cannabinoids (such as HU-210). All of the endocannabinoids and plant cannabinoids are lipophilic, such as fat soluble compounds.
There are currently two known subtypes of cannabinoid receptors, termed CB1 and CB2. The CB1 receptor is expressed mainly in the brain (central nervous system or "CNS"), but also in the lungs, liver and kidneys. The CB2 receptor is expressed mainly in the immune system and in hematopoietic cells. Mounting evidence suggests that there are novel cannabinoid receptors that is, non-CB1 and non-CB2, which are expressed in endothelial cells and in the CNS. In 2007, the binding of several cannabinoids to the G protein-coupled receptor GPR55 in the brain was described.
The protein sequences of CB1 and CB2 receptors are about 44\% similar. When only the transmembrane regions of the receptors are considered, amino acid similarity between the two receptor subtypes is approximately 68\%. In addition, minor variations in each receptor have been identified. Cannabinoids bind reversibly and stereo-selectively to the cannabinoid receptors. Subtype selective cannabinoids have been developed which theoretically may have advantages for treatment of certain diseases such as obesity.},

Recently, deep neural networks have proven to be very effective in pattern recognition, classification tasks and human-level control to model highly nonlinear realworld systems. This paper investigates the effectiveness of deep neural networks in the modeling of dynamical systems with complex behavior. Three deep neural network structures are trained on sequential data, and we investigate the effectiveness of these networks in modeling associated characteristics of the underlying dynamical systems. We carry out similar evaluations on select publicly available system identification datasets. We demonstrate that deep neural networks are effective model estimators from input-output data},

Mathematical computations of LFPs allow the study of circuit functions and dysfunctions via simulations. This paper introduces LFPsim, a NEURON-based tool for computing population LFP activity and single neuron extracellular potentials. LFPsim was developed to be used on existing cable compartmental neuron and network models. Point source, line source, and RC based filter approximations can be used to compute extracellular activity. As a demonstration of efficient implementation, we showcase LFPs from mathematical models of electrotonically compact cerebellum granule neurons and morphologically complex neurons of the neocortical column. LFPsim reproduced neocortical LFP at 8, 32, and 56 Hz via current injection, in vitro post-synaptic N2a, N2b waves and in vivo T-C waves in cerebellum granular layer. LFPsim also includes a simulation of multi-electrode array of LFPs in network populations to aid computational inference between biophysical activity in neural networks and corresponding multi-unit activity resulting in extracellular and evoked LFP signals.},

  abstract = {We use recent advances in the machine learning area known as 'reservoir computing' to formulate a method for model-free estimation from data of the Lyapunov exponents of a chaotic process. The technique uses a limited time series of measurements as input to a high-dimensional dynamical system called a 'reservoir'. After the reservoir's response to the data is recorded, linear regression is used to learn a large set of parameters, called the 'output weights'. The learned output weights are then used to form a modified autonomous reservoir designed to be capable of producing arbitrarily long time series whose ergodic properties approximate those of the input signal. When successful, we say that the autonomous reservoir reproduces the attractor's 'climate'. Since the reservoir equations and output weights are known, we can compute derivatives needed to determine the Lyapunov exponents of the autonomous reservoir, which we then use as estimates of the Lyapunov exponents for the original input generating system. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique with two examples, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation. In particular, we use the Lorenz system to show that achieving climate reproduction may require tuning of the reservoir parameters. For the case of the KS equation, we note that as the system's spatial size is increased, the number of Lyapunov exponents increases, thus yielding a challenging test of our method, which we find the method successfully passes.},

We investigated the network model composed of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP) developed by A. Nevado Holgado et al. [(2010) Journal of Neuroscience, 30, 12340\textendash 12352], who identified the conditions under which this circuit could generate beta oscillations. Our work extended their analysis by deriving improved analytic stability conditions for realistic values of the synaptic transmission delay between STN and GP neurons. The improved conditions were significantly closer to the results of simulations for the range of synaptic transmission delays measured experimentally. Furthermore, our analysis explained how changes in cortical and striatal input to the STN\textendash GP network influenced oscillations generated by the circuit. As we have identified when a system of mutually connected populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons can generate oscillations, our results may also find applications in the study of neural oscillations produced by assemblies of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in other brain regions.},

This paper introduces two methods of predicting axon activation that incorporate a threshold that includes the magnitude of the extracellular potential to achieve increased accuracy over previous computationally efficient methods. Each method uses a modified driving function that includes the second spatial difference of the applied extracellular voltage to predict the electrical excitation of a nerve. The first method uses the second spatial difference taken at a single node of Ranvier, while the second uses a weighted sum of the second spatial differences taken at all nodes of Ranvier. This study quantifies prediction accuracy for cases with single and multiple point source stimulating electrodes. While both new methods address the major criticism of linearized prediction models, the weighted sum method provides the most robust response across single and multiple point sources. These methods improve prediction of axon activation based on properties of the applied field in a computationally efficient manner.},

  abstract = {Learning from examples is one of the key problems in science and engineering. It deals with function reconstruction from a finite set of direct and noisy samples. Regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) is widely used to solve this task and includes powerful estimators such as regularization networks. Recent achievements include the proof of the statistical consistency of these kernel- based approaches. Parallel to this, many different system identification techniques have been developed but the interaction with machine learning does not appear so strong yet. One reason is that the RKHSs usually employed in machine learning do not embed the information available on dynamic systems, e.g. BIBO stability. In addition, in system identification the independent data assumptions routinely adopted in machine learning are never satisfied in practice. This paper provides new results which strengthen the connection between system identification and machine learning. Our starting point is the introduction of RKHSs of dynamic systems. They contain functionals over spaces defined by system inputs and allow to interpret system identification as learning from examples. In both linear and nonlinear settings, it is shown that this perspective permits to derive in a relatively simple way conditions on RKHS stability (i.e. the property of containing only BIBO stable systems or predictors), also facilitating the design of new kernels for system identification. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the regularized estimator to the optimal predictor under conditions typical of dynamic systems.},

Twenty patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent bilateral STN-DBS were studied. Patients were assessed preoperatively and followed up for one year using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in "on" and "off" medication and "on" and "off" stimulation conditions. At one-year follow-up, we calculated significant improvement in all the motor aspects of PD (UPDRS III) and in activities of daily living (UPDRS II) in the "off" medication state. The "off" medication UPDRS improved by 49.3\%, tremors improved by 81.6\%, rigidity improved by 50.0\%, and bradykinesia improved by 39.3\%. The "off" medication UPDRS II scores improved by 73.8\%. The Levodopa equivalent daily dose was reduced by 54.1\%. The UPDRS IVa score (dyskinesia) was reduced by 65.1\%. The UPDRS IVb score (motor fluctuation) was reduced by 48.6\%. Deep brain stimulation of the STN improves the cardinal motor manifestations of the idiopathic PD. It also improves activities of daily living, and reduces medication-induced complications.},

The proceedings of the Sixth Annual Think Tank recapitulate progress in applications of neurotechnology, neurophysiology, and emerging techniques for the treatment of a range of psychiatric and neurological conditions including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy, cognitive disorders, and addiction. Each section of this overview provides insight about the understanding of neuromodulation for specific disease and discusses current challenges and future directions. This year's report addresses key issues in implementing advanced neurophysiological techniques, evolving use of novel modulation techniques to deliver DBS, ans improved neuroimaging techniques. The proceedings also offer insights into the new era of brain network neuromodulation and connectomic DBS to define and target dysfunctional brain networks. The proceedings also focused on innovations in applications and understanding of adaptive DBS (closed-loop systems), the use and applications of optogenetics in the field of neurostimulation and the need to develop databases for DBS indications. Finally, updates on neuroethical, legal, social, and policy issues relevant to DBS research are discussed.},

These advances serve as both ``markers of progress'' and challenges and opportunities for ongoing address, engagement, and deliberation as we move to improve the functional capabilities and translational value of DBS. It is in this light that these proceedings are presented to inform the field and initiate ongoing discourse. As consistent with the intent, and spirit of this, and prior DBS Think Tanks, the overarching goal is to continue to develop multidisciplinary collaborations to rapidly advance the field and ultimately improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {The mammalian striatum receives its main excitatory input from the two types of cortical pyramidal neurons of layer 5 of the cerebral cortex \textendash{} those with only intratelencephalic connections (IT-type) and those sending their main axon to the brainstem via the pyramidal tract (PT-type). These two neurons types are present in layer 5 of all cortical regions, and thus they appear to project together to all parts of striatum. These two neuron types, however, differ genetically, morphologically, and functionally, with IT-type neurons conveying sensory and motor planning information to striatum and PT-type neurons conveying an efference copy of motor commands (for motor cortex at least). Anatomical and physiological data for rats, and more recent data for primates, indicate that these two cortical neuron types also differ in their targeting of the two main types of striatal projection neurons, with the IT-type input preferentially innervating direct pathway neurons and the PT-type input preferentially innervating indirect pathway striatal neurons. These findings have implications for understanding how the direct and indirect pathways carry out their respective roles in movement facilitation and movement suppression, and they have implications for understanding the role of corticostriatal synaptic plasticity in adaptive motor control by the basal ganglia.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}The intestinal microbiota influence neurodevelopment, modulate behavior, and contribute to neurological disorders. However, a functional link between gut bacteria and neurodegenerative diseases remains unexplored. Synucleinopathies are characterized by aggregation of the protein {$\alpha$}-synuclein ({$\alpha$}Syn), often resulting in motor dysfunction as exemplified by Parkinson's disease (PD). Using mice that overexpress {$\alpha$}Syn, we report herein that gut microbiota are required for motor deficits, microglia activation, and {$\alpha$}Syn pathology. Antibiotic treatment ameliorates, while microbial re-colonization promotes, pathophysiology in adult animals, suggesting that postnatal signaling between the gut and the brain modulates disease. Indeed, oral administration of specific microbial metabolites to germ-free mice promotes neuroinflammation and motor symptoms. Remarkably, colonization of {$\alpha$}Syn-overexpressing mice with microbiota from PD-affected patients enhances physical impairments compared to microbiota transplants from healthy human donors. These findings reveal that gut bacteria regulate movement disorders in mice and suggest that alterations in the human microbiome represent a risk factor for PD.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {High-frequency deep brain stimulation (HFS) is clinically recognized to treat parkinsonian movement disorders, but its mechanisms remain elusive. Current hypotheses suggest that the therapeutic merit of HFS stems from increasing the regularity of the firing patterns in the basal ganglia (BG). Although this is consistent with experiments in humans and animal models of Parkinsonism, it is unclear how the pattern regularization would originate from HFS. To address this question, we built a computational model of the cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical loop in normal and parkinsonian conditions. We simulated the effects of subthalamic deep brain stimulation both proximally to the stimulation site and distally through orthodromic and antidromic mechanisms for several stimulation frequencies (20\textendash 180 Hz) and, correspondingly, we studied the evolution of the firing patterns in the loop. The model closely reproduced experimental evidence for each structure in the loop and showed that neither the proximal effects nor the distal effects individually account for the observed pattern changes, whereas the combined impact of these effects increases with the stimulation frequency and becomes significant for HFS. Perturbations evoked proximally and distally propagate along the loop, rendezvous in the striatum, and, for HFS, positively overlap (reinforcement), thus causing larger poststimulus activation and more regular patterns in striatum. Reinforcement is maximal for the clinically relevant 130-Hz stimulation and restores a more normal activity in the nuclei downstream. These results suggest that reinforcement may be pivotal to achieve pattern regularization and restore the neural activity in the nuclei downstream and may stem from frequency-selective resonant properties of the loop.},

  abstract = {Background: Measures of spike train synchrony are widely used in both experimental and computational neuroscience. Time-scale independent and parameter-free measures, such as the ISI-distance, the SPIKEdistance and SPIKE-synchronization, are preferable to time scale parametric measures, since by adapting to the local firing rate they take into account all the time scales of a given dataset. New method: In data containing multiple time scales (e.g. regular spiking and bursts) one is typically less interested in the smallest time scales and a more adaptive approach is needed. Here we propose the AISI-distance, the A-SPIKE-distance and A-SPIKE-synchronization, which generalize the original measures by considering the local relative to the global time scales. For the A-SPIKE-distance we also introduce a rate-independent extension called the RIA-SPIKE-distance, which focuses specifically on spike timing.
Results: The adaptive generalizations A-ISI-distance and A-SPIKE-distance allow to disregard spike time differences that are not relevant on a more global scale. A-SPIKE-synchronization does not any longer demand an unreasonably high accuracy for spike doublets and coinciding bursts. Finally, the RIA-SPIKEdistance proves to be independent of rate ratios between spike trains.
Comparison with existing methods: We find that compared to the original versions the A-ISI-distance and the A-SPIKE-distance yield improvements for spike trains containing different time scales without exhibiting any unwanted side effects in other examples. A-SPIKE-synchronization matches spikes more efficiently than SPIKE-synchronization.
Conclusions: With these proposals we have completed the picture, since we now provide adaptive generalized measures that are sensitive to firing rate only (A-ISI-distance), to timing only (ARI-SPIKE-distance), and to both at the same time (A-SPIKE-distance).},

  title = {Which Spike Train Distance Is Most Suitable for Distinguishing Rate and Temporal Coding?},
  author = {Satuvuori, Eero and Kreuz, Thomas},
  year = {2018},
  month = feb,
  abstract = {Background: It is commonly assumed in neuronal coding that repeated presentations of a stimulus to a coding neuron elicit similar responses. One common way to assess similarity are spike train distances. These can be divided into spike-resolved, such as the Victor-Purpura and the van Rossum distance, and time-resolved, e.g. the ISI-, the SPIKE- and the RI-SPIKE-distance. New Method: We use independent steady-rate Poisson processes as surrogates for spike trains with fixed rate and no timing information to address two basic questions: How does the sensitivity of the different spike train distances to temporal coding depend on the rates of the two processes and how do the distances deal with very low rates?
Results: Spike-resolved distances always contain rate information even for parameters indicating time coding. This is an issue for reasonably high rates but beneficial for very low rates. In contrast, the operational range for detecting time coding of time-resolved distances is superior at normal rates, but these measures produce artefacts at very low rates. The RI-SPIKE-distance is the only measure that is sensitive to timing information only.
Comparison with Existing Methods: While our results on rate-dependent expectation values for the spike-resolved distances agree with Chicharro et al. (2011), we here go one step further and specifically investigate applicability for very low rates.
Conclusions: The most appropriate measure depends on the rates of the data being analysed. Accordingly, we summarize our results in one table that allows an easy selection of the preferred measure for any kind of data.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms for the emergence and transmission of synchronized oscillations in Parkinson's disease, which are potentially causal to motor deficits, remain debated. Aside from the motor cortex and the subthalamic nucleus, the external globus pallidus (GPe) has been shown to be essential for the maintenance of these oscillations and plays a major role in sculpting neural network activity in the basal ganglia (BG). While neural activity of the healthy GPe shows almost no correlations between pairs of neurons, prominent synchronization in the {$\beta$} frequency band arises after dopamine depletion. Several studies have proposed that this shift is due to network interactions between the different BG nuclei, including the GPe. However, recent studies demonstrate an important role for the properties of neurons within the GPe. In this review, we will discuss these intrinsic GPe properties and review proposed mechanisms for activity decorrelation within the dopamine-intact GPe. Failure of the GPe to desynchronize correlated inputs can be a possible explanation for synchronization in the whole BG. Potential triggers of synchronization involve the enhancement of GPe-GPe inhibition and changes in ion channel function in GPe neurons.},

For this corticosubthalamic oscillatory drive to be mechanistically important, it must influence the firing of STN neurons and, consequently, their downstream targets. Here, we examined the dynamics of synchronisation between STN LFPs and units with multiple cortical areas, measured using frontal ECoG, midline EEG and lateral EEG, during rest and movement. STN neurons lagged cortical signals recorded over midline (over premotor cortices) and frontal (over prefrontal cortices) with stable time delays, consistent with strong corticosubthalamic drive, and many neurons maintained these dynamics during movement. In contrast, most STN neurons desynchronised from lateral EEG signals (over primary motor cortices) during movement and those that did not had altered phase relations to the cortical signals. The strength of synchronisation between STN units and midline EEG in the high beta range (25\textendash 35 Hz) correlated positively with the severity of akinetic-rigid motor symptoms across patients. Together, these results suggest that sustained synchronisation of STN neurons to premotor-cortical beta oscillations play an important role in disrupting the normal coding of movement in PD.},

  abstract = {Beta frequency oscillations (15-29Hz) are among the most prominent signatures of brain activity. Beta power is predictive of many healthy and abnormal behaviors, including perception, attention and motor action. Recent evidence shows that in non-averaged signals, beta can emerge as transient high-power "events". As such, functionally relevant differences in averaged power across time and trials can reflect accumulated changes in the number, power, duration, and/or frequency span of the events. We show for the first time that functionally relevant differences in averaged prestimulus beta power in human sensory neocortex reflects a difference in the number of high-power beta events per trial, i.e., the rate of events. Further, high power beta events close to the time of the stimulus were more likely to impair perception. This result is consistent across detection and attention tasks in human magnetoencephalography (MEG) and is conserved in local field potential (LFP) recordings of mice performing a detection task. Our findings suggest transient brain rhythms are best viewed as a "rate metric" in their impact on function, and provides a new framework for understanding and manipulating functionally relevant rhythmic events.},

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

  month = feb,
  abstract = {Even though convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are driving progress in medical image segmentation, standard models still have some drawbacks. First, the use of multi-scale approaches, i.e., encoder-decoder architectures, leads to a redundant use of information, where similar low-level features are extracted multiple times at multiple scales. Second, long-range feature dependencies are not efficiently modeled, resulting in non-optimal discriminative feature representations associated with each semantic class. In this paper we attempt to overcome these limitations with the proposed architecture, by capturing richer contextual dependencies based on the use of guided self-attention mechanisms. This approach is able to integrate local features with their corresponding global dependencies, as well as highlight interdependent channel maps in an adaptive manner. Further, the additional loss between different modules guides the attention mechanisms to neglect irrelevant information and focus on more discriminant regions of the image by emphasizing relevant feature associations. We evaluate the proposed model in the context of semantic segmentation on three different datasets: abdominal organs, cardiovascular structures and brain tumors. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these attention modules in the proposed architecture. In addition, compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation networks our model yields better segmentation performance, increasing the accuracy of the predictions while reducing the standard deviation. This demonstrates the efficiency of our approach to generate precise and reliable automatic segmentations of medical images.

  abstract = {In the normal brain beta band oscillatory activity has been associated with retaining of ongoing motor activities. In Parkinson's disease, enhanced beta band oscillatory activity is displayed across the cortico-basal ganglia pathway and is one of the prominent neurophysiological phenomena associated with the disorder. Intraoperative and postoperative recordings of neural activity in patients undergoing stereotactic neurosurgery combined with studies in animal models of parkinsonism have led to the accumulation of complementary data regarding these oscillations. In this review we address some of the key issues facing researchers in the field. These issues encompass existing agreements as well as open debates in modern studies of beta band oscillations, including their defining characteristics, links to clinical symptoms and the functional properties of their formation and effects on behavior. We address these questions by comparing and contrasting the results of neurophysiological observations in human patients, MPTP primate model and 6-OHDA rat model with conceptual and computational models of the normal and parkinsonian basal ganglia. Defining a unifying scheme of beta band oscillations and their relation to neurophysiological, functional and clinical phenomena will enable future targeting of these oscillations for both diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},

              BACKGROUND
              Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) stimulation is a novel therapy for Parkinson disease. However, controversies remain regarding the clinical application of this new therapy, including patient selection, electrode positioning, and how best to assess outcomes.
            
            
              OBJECTIVE
              To clarify the clinical application of PPN stimulation in Parkinson disease.
            
            
              METHODS
              Five consecutive patients with Parkinson disease complicated by severe gait freezing, postural instability, and frequent falls (all persisting even while the patient was on medication) received bilateral stimulation of the mid-lower PPN without costimulation of other brain targets. Outcomes were assessed prospectively over 2 years with gait-specific questionnaires and the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (part III).
            
            
              RESULTS
              The primary outcome, the Gait and Falls Questionnaire score, improved significantly with stimulation. Benefits were maintained over 2 years. Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (part III) items assessing gait and posture were relatively insensitive to these treatment effects. Beneficial effects often appeared to outlast stimulation for hours or longer. Thus, single-session on- vs off-stimulation assessments may be susceptible to ``delayed washout effects.'' Stimulation of the PPN did not change akinesia scores or dopaminergic medication requirements.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Bilateral stimulation of the mid-lower PPN (more caudal than previous reports) without costimulation of other brain targets may be beneficial for the subgroup of patients with Parkinson disease who experience severe gait freezing and postural instability with frequent falls, which persist even while on medication. Choosing appropriate outcome measures and accounting for the possibility of prolonged stimulation washout effects appear to be important for detecting the clinical benefits.},

  abstract = {Gamma-frequency (30-70 Hz) oscillations in populations of interneurons may be of functional relevance in the brain by virtue of their ability to induce synchronous firing in principal neurons. Such a role would require that neurons, 1 mm or more apart, be able to synchronize their activity, despite the presence of axonal conduction delays and of the limited axonal spread of many interneurons. We showed previously that interneuron doublet firing can help to synchronize gamma oscillations, provided that sufficiently many pyramidal neurons are active; we also suggested that gap junctions, between the axons of principal neurons, could contribute to the long-range synchrony of gamma oscillations induced in the hippocampus by carbachol in vitro. Here we consider interneuron network gamma: that is, gamma oscillations in pharmacologically isolated networks of tonically excited interneurons, with frequency gated by mutual GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSPs. We provide simulation and electrophysiological evidence that interneuronal gap junctions (presumably dendritic) can enhance the synchrony of such gamma oscillations, in spatially extended interneuron networks. There appears to be a sharp threshold conductance, below which the interneuron dendritic gap junctions do not exert a synchronizing role.},

The algorithm is based on an earlier theoretical result that guarantees the quality of the network approximation. We show that a feedforward neural network can be trained on the vector field representation of a given dynamical system using backpropagation, then recast, using matrix manipulations, as a recurrent network that replicates the original system's dynamics. After detailing this algorithm and its relation to earlier approaches, we present numerical examples that demonstrate its capabilities. One of the distinguishing features of our approach is that both the original dynamical systems and the recurrent networks that simulate them operate in continuous time.},

  abstract = {Dynamical systems with high intrinsic dimensionality are often characterized by extreme events having the form of rare transitions several standard deviations away from the mean. For such systems, order-reduction methods through projection of the governing equations have limited applicability due to the large intrinsic dimensionality of the underlying attractor but also the complexity of the transient events. An alternative approach is data-driven techniques that aim to quantify the dynamics of specific modes utilizing data-streams. Several of these approaches have improved performance by expanding the state representation using delayed coordinates. However, such strategies are limited in regions of the phase space where there is a small amount of data available, as is the case for extreme events. In this work, we develop a blended framework that integrates an imperfect model, obtained from projecting equations into a subspace that still contains crucial dynamical information, with data-streams through a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. In particular, we employ the long-short-term memory (LSTM), to model portions of the dynamics which cannot be accounted by the equations. The RNN is trained by analyzing the mismatch between the imperfect model and the data-streams, projected in the reduced-order space. In this way, the data-driven model improves the imperfect model in regions where data is available, while for locations where data is sparse the imperfect model still provides a baseline for the prediction of the system dynamics. We assess the developed framework on two challenging prototype systems exhibiting extreme events and show that the blended approach has improved performance compared with methods that use either data streams or the imperfect model alone. The improvement is more significant in regions associated with extreme events, where data is sparse.},

  abstract = {The glutamatergic projection from the motor cortex to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) constitutes the corticobasal ganglia circuit and plays a critical role in the control of movement. Emerging evidence shows that the cortico-STN pathway is susceptible to dopamine depletion. Specifically in Parkinson's disease (PD), abnormal electrophysiological activities were observed in the motor cortex and STN, while the STN serves as a key target of deep brain stimulation for PD therapy. However, direct morphological changes in the cortico-STN connectivity in response to PD progress are poorly understood at present. In the present study, we used a transsynaptic anterograde tracing method with herpes simplex virus-green fluorescent protein (HSV-GFP) to monitor the cortico-STN connectivity in a rat model of PD. We found that the connectivity from the primary motor cortex (M1) to the STN was impaired in parkinsonian rats as manifested by a marked decrease in trans-synaptic infection of HSV-GFP from M1 neurons to STN neurons in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. Ultrastructural analysis with electron microscopy revealed that excitatory synapses in the STN were also impaired in parkinsonian rats. Glutamatergic terminals identified by a specific marker (vesicular glutamate transporter 1) were reduced in the STN, while glutamatergic neurons showed an insignificant change in their total number in both the M1 and STN regions. These results indicate that the M1-STN glutamatergic connectivity is downregulated in parkinsonian rats. This downregulation is mediated probably via a mechanism involving the impairments of excitatory terminals and synapses in the STN.},

  abstract = {Background

Rapid action stopping leads to global motor suppression. This is shown by studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure corticospinal excitability of task-unrelated effectors (e.g., from the hand during speech stopping). We hypothesize that this global suppression relates to the STN of the basal ganglia. Several STN local field potential studies in PD patients have shown increased \ss -band power during successful stopping.

Objectives

Here, we aimed to test whether this STN \ss -band activity indexes global motor suppression measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation.

Methods

We studied 9 medicated PD patients (age, 47-67 years; mean, 55.8; 3 female) who were implanted with STN-DBS electrodes. Participants performed a vocal stop-signal task (i.e., they had to occasionally stop a vocal response) while we simultaneously recorded local field potentials from right STN and delivered transcranial magnetic stimulation to primary motor cortex to measure corticospinal excitability from a task-unrelated hand muscle (first dorsal interosseous).

Results

Replicating previous results, STN \ss -band power was increased (P\,{$<$}\,0.005) and corticospinal excitability was reduced (P\,=\,0.024; global motor suppression) during successful stopping. As hypothesized, global motor suppression was greater for successful stop trials with higher STN \ss -power (median split: P\,=\,0.043), which was further evident in a negative correlation between single-trial STN \ss -power and corticospinal excitability (mean, r\,=\,-0.176; P\,=\,0.011).

Conclusion

These findings link stopping-related global motor suppression to STN \ss -band activity through simultaneous recordings of STN and corticospinal excitability. The results support models of basal ganglia function that propose the STN has broad motor suppressive effects. \textcopyright{} 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a successful surgical therapy used to treat the disabling symptoms of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. It involves the chronic stimulation of disorder-specific nuclei. However, the mechanisms that lead to clinical improvements remain unclear. Consequently, this slows the optimization of present-day DBS therapy and hinders its future development and application. We used a computational model to calculate the distribution of electric potential induced by DBS and study the effect of stimulation on the spiking activity of a subthalamic nucleus (STN) projection neuron. We previously showed that such a model can reveal detailed spatial effects of stimulation in the vicinity of the electrode. However, this multi-compartmental STN neuron model can fire in either a burst or tonic mode and, in this study, we hypothesized that the firing mode of the cell will have a major impact on the DBS-induced effects. Our simulations showed that the bursting model exhibits behaviour observed in studies of high-frequency stimulation of STN neurons, such as the presence of a silent period at stimulation offset and frequency-dependent stimulation effects. We validated the model by simulating the clinical parameter settings used for a Parkinsonian patient and showed, in a patient-specific anatomical model, that the region of affected tissue is consistent with clinical observations of the optimal DBS site. Our results demonstrated a method of quantitatively assessing neuronal changes induced by DBS, to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize unwanted side effects.},

  abstract = {A vast majority of computation in the brain is performed by spiking neural networks. Despite the ubiquity of such spiking, we currently lack an understanding of how biological spiking neural circuits learn and compute in vivo, as well as how we can instantiate such capabilities in artificial spiking circuits in silico. Here we revisit the problem of supervised learning in temporally coding multilayer spiking neural networks. First, by using a surrogate gradient approach, we derive SuperSpike, a nonlinear voltage-based three-factor learning rule capable of training multilayer networks of deterministic integrate-and-fire neurons to perform nonlinear computations on spatiotemporal spike patterns. Second, inspired by recent results on feedback alignment, we compare the performance of our learning rule under different credit assignment strategies for propagating output errors to hidden units. Specifically, we test uniform, symmetric, and random feedback, finding that simpler tasks can be solved with any type of feedback, while more complex tasks require symmetric feedback. In summary, our results open the door to obtaining a better scientific understanding of learning and computation in spiking neural networks by advancing our ability to train them to solve nonlinear problems involving transformations between different spatiotemporal spike time patterns.},

However, unlike \textbackslash cite\{zaheer2017latent\}, we do not make any factorization assumptions in our inference algorithm.

  abstract = {Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.},
