<!-- l. 50 --><p class='indent'>   Next to in vivo experimentation, computational modeling is a valuable approach to test
interventions in neuronal circuits <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>in silico </span>that avoids the risks and costs associated
with animal and human studies. Not only can it serve as a translational tool to
bring insights from neuroscience to clinical applications, it can also serve as a safe
environment for the design and testing of DBS control algorithms <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xmodolo_model-driven_2011'>253</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xbeuter_closed-loop_2014'>32</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xhuys_computational_2016'>161</a>]</span>.
Building on this approach, the primary aim of this thesis was to develop a detailed
computational model of the basal ganglia network that can be used to investigate the
pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease and therapeutic interventions that aim to correct
it. To achieve these aims, a key requirement of the computational model was that
it captures the essential biophysical properties that shape pathological neuronal
unit and network activity, and the effects exerted by DBS upon it. Moreover, the
model should be implemented in a computationally efficient manner that allows
time-efficient simulation of the network behavior under different parameter settings.
The resulting model can then be used to elucidate mechanisms of pathophysiology
and the mechanism of action of DBS, jointly at the cellular and network level. The
insights gained using the model can be used in a translational fashion, to improve the
efficacy of established DBS protocols and to guide the design of novel stimulation
                                                                                

                                                                                
protocols.
</p><!-- l. 72 --><p class='indent'>   A novel biophysically detailed model of the parkinsonian STN-GPe network was developed
that meets the requirements set forth in the aims. The model was implemented for parallel
execution across multiple processors. This enabled network simulations on time scales of
several hours, and demonstrates the feasibility of biophysically detailed network modeling by
leveraging distributed computer architectures. The model was used to investigate the
mechanisms underlying the emergence of pathological beta-band oscillatory activity in the
STN-GPe network, which is correlated with akinetic-bradykinetic motor symptoms of
Parkinson’s disease. It was shown that the STN-GPe feedback loop has an intrinsic
susceptibility to beta-band oscillations that is manifest in weak autonomously generated
oscillations that are strengthened by resonant interactions with cortical beta-band oscillatory
inputs. Resonance is established by phase-locking to cortical oscillatory inputs in the
dopamine depleted condition and is further amplified by striatal beta inputs that promote
anti-phase firing of the cortex and GPe. The deleterious phase relationships between
population spiking activity in BG nuclei that enable strong phase locking are mediated by
abnormal synaptic transmission and modulation of ion channel conductances by
dopamine depletion. These changes affect the balance of excitation and inhibition in
neurons, their excitability, and their effective time constants of synaptic integration.
The detailed network model of the STN-GPe feedback loop was extended using 3D
neuron morphologies positioned inside a 3D reconstruction of the rat brain and
axon cable models were included for each cell. The resulting anatomically detailed
network model was used to elucidate mechanism of local cellular activation by DBS,
and of orthodromic and antidromic action potential propagation during ongoing
parkinsonian network activity. The results revealed mixed excitatory/inhibitory
effects of HFS DBS on STN somata depending on the orientations and positions of
neural elements, and strong antidromic activation of GPe neurons. Moreover it was
shown how the decoupling between somatic and axonal spiking in STN neurons was
sensitive to differential short-term depression in the synapses of stimulated afferents.
Furthermore, based on the insights about deleterious phase relationships in PD, a
phase-locked DBS protocol was tested in the network that disrupts phase locking in STN
neurons by changing the relative phases of afferent spiking activity. Phase-locked
DBS consisted of low-frequency (20 Hz) pulses delivered in anti-phase relative to
20 Hz cortical oscillatory inputs. The suppression of beta-band oscillations in the
                                                                                

                                                                                
LFP using this low-frequency protocol suggests that phase-locked DBS could be an
alternative to the established HFS DBS that is less disruptive to ongoing network
activity.

<!-- l. 140 --><p class='noindent'>The network model developed for this thesis was the first model of the STN-GPe network in
the basal ganglia that consists of biophysically detailed multi-compartment neuron models.
Despite the level of detail included in the model, because of its parallel implementation it does
not come with a prohibitive cost in terms of execution time compared to networks consisting
of single-compartment neuron models. The use of detailed multi-compartment neuron
models allowed us to take into consideration for the first time the interplay of active
dendritic channel currents and synaptic currents in shaping pathological unit and
network activity. These interactions were captured by delivering synaptic inputs to
precise locations in the dendritic trees where they activate locally expressed ion
channels. This revealed how strong burst firing modes in the STN were replaced by
sparser spiking and higher frequency beta-band activity depending on the balance of
dendritic excitation and inhibition, which regulated the availability of burst-generating
<!-- l. 162 --><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><mi>C</mi><msup><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo class='MathClass-bin'>+</mo></mrow></msup></math>
channels.
</p><!-- l. 170 --><p class='indent'>   The model showed an intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations that was manifest in
weak autonomously generated oscillations within the reciprocally connected STN-GPe loop
and in selective amplification of exogenous beta-band spiking inputs near the network’s
endogenous oscillation frequency. Specifically, the frequency response of the STN-GPe network
showed a resonance peak in the beta-band range and the frequency at which the peak
occurred was determined by the ratio of excitation to inhibition in the STN. As
this ratio decreased, which is supported experimentally by cortical de-afferentiation
and strengthening of GPe synapses after dopamine depletion, the resonance peak
                                                                                

                                                                                
increased in magnitude and shifted toward the lower beta-band range. Hence, the model
hypothesizes a new mechanism by which beta-band resonance arises in the STN-GPe
loop.
</p><!-- l. 182 --><p class='indent'>   The model also provided new insights into the role of phase relationships and synaptic
receptors in generating pathological activity. Autonomously generated oscillations were strong
only when GPe-STN synaptic inputs were dominated by short time constant GABA<sub class='textsubscript'><span class='cmr-10'>A</span></sub>-receptor
mediated currents while GABA<sub class='textsubscript'><span class='cmr-10'>B</span></sub>-mediated currents were weak. However, strong bursting in
STN neurons required higher inhibition of the STN and the presence of slower GABA<sub class='textsubscript'><span class='cmr-10'>B</span></sub>
mediated currents. This indicates an important role for GABA<sub class='textsubscript'><span class='cmr-10'>B</span></sub> receptors in the
pathophysiology of Parkinson’s Disease in STN neurons. The weak autonomous oscillations in
the presence of strong GABA<sub class='textsubscript'><span class='cmr-10'>B</span></sub> currents and bursting did not support a key pacemaker role for
the STN-GPe network in the generation of beta-band oscillations. Moreover, beta-band
resonance in the STN-GPe network could be either suppressed or amplified by beta-band
striatal inputs to the GPe, depending on the phase relationships in the network. Resonance
was amplified by striatal beta inputs that promoted anti-phase firing of the cortex and
GPe, resulting in maximum transient inhibition of STN neurons. This highlights
the role of phase relationships between populating spiking activity in shaping the
interaction of beta-band oscillations converging onto the STN-GPe loop through different
pathways.
</p><!-- l. 203 --><p class='indent'>   The mechanism of oscillation in the model presented is consistent with that of previous
models where alternating phases of excitation and inhibition in the delayed negative feedback
loop consisting of STN and GPe give rise to a sustained oscillation pattern (see Section <a href='indexch3.html#x8-590003.4.2'>3.4.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:ch3-disc:osc-mech-others  --></a>).
However, the detailed model further illustrates the role of precisely timed excitation and
inhibition in STN, orchestrated by the direct and indirect pathways, in transiently
de-inactivating somatic and dendritic ion channels to establish strong phase-locking to its
excitatory inputs. Moreover, it highlights the sensitivity of the oscillation and bursting
patterns generated by the network to the excitation-inhibition balance in each population and
synaptic current properties.
</p><!-- l. 215 --><p class='indent'>   The model gives a mechanistic account of the generation of exaggerated oscillatory activity
in the STN-GPe network that is poorly understood from experimental data alone, where the
observable variables reflect the state of the network more indirectly. Moreover, the
computational model allows precise control over variables that are hard to control in vivo or in
vitro, such as the excitation-inhibition balance in cells and the phase relationships between
                                                                                

                                                                                
spiking inputs to the network. This enables the investigation of the individual contributions of
these variables to network pathophysiology, which is difficult to do in vitro or in
vivo.

   <h4 class='subsectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>6.1.2   </span> <a id='x11-900006.1.2'></a>DBS model</h4>
<!-- l. 231 --><p class='noindent'>To leverage the biophysically detailed network model for the understanding and design of DBS
control algorithms, it was extended into a 3D anatomical model. The 3D model was
constructed by placing cell morphologies within BG nuclei in an atlas-based reconstruction of
the rat brain. Moreover, it included multi-compartment models of the axonal projections
between the STN and GPe, and of the hyperdirect pathway originating in the cortex. This was
the first study where the distributed effects of DBS on detailed neuronal morphologies were
investigated during ongoing network activity. Importantly, this allowed us to characterize for
the first time the effect of stimulus-locked action potentials in multiple fiber bundles,
propagating orthodromically and antidromically along axons in the network and
disrupting intrinsic population spiking both downstream and upstream of the stimulation
site.
</p><!-- l. 254 --><p class='indent'>   Simulation results indicated that antidromic recruitment of GPe neurons via the
GPe-STN projection could play an important role in the network effects of DBS.
Furthermore, the results further clarified seemingly contradictory data in the literature
reporting either excitatory or inhibitory effects of DBS on somatic spiking activity.
Entrainment of STN somata to HFS DBS was variable, and cells were either excited or
inhibited, depending on local neurite orientations and location with respect to the
electrode. Moreover, there were different degrees of dissociation between somatic and
axonal spiking between neurons. The degree of dissociation was shown to depend
on differential short-term depression in excitatory and inhibitory afferents to the
STN, confirming existing hypotheses based on experimental recordings. Finally, the
model gave new insights into the mechanism of closed-loop, phase-locked stimulation
protocols that are emerging as candidates to replace traditional high-frequency DBS.
Application of a low-frequency stimulation protocol that was phase-locked to the
cortical beta-band oscillations entering the network revealed an optimal phase of
                                                                                

                                                                                
stimulation for the suppression of beta-band oscillations in the LFP. Specifically,
stimulating 180 degrees out-of-phase with respect to the onset of cortical bursts
dispersed STN spiking throughout the oscillation period resulting in the suppression of
phase-locking.
</p><!-- l. 275 --><p class='indent'>   Hence, the model yielded new insights into the possible mechanisms of phase-locked
stimulation, which is a promising candidate therapy for Parkinson’s disease that is
actively being investigated <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xholt_phase-dependent_2019'>155</a>]</span>. Moreover, the model and the resulting insights
could be used in future studies to optimize the control parameters and electrode
placements for phase-locked stimulation as well as other closed-loop DBS control
algorithms

   <h4 class='subsectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>6.1.3   </span> <a id='x11-910006.1.3'></a>Reduced STN-GPe network model</h4>
<!-- l. 288 --><p class='noindent'>To capture the biophysical properties that determine pathological neuronal activity in the
STN-GPe network and its interaction with DBS, morphological neuron models were assumed
to provide a sufficient level of detail. However, such models consist of a large number of state
variables, which burden them with high computational complexity and potentially a
superfluous level of detail. Because the aim was to create a model that provides the <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>essential</span>
level of detail to capture these properties, a reduced network model was developed
based on the original detailed model. The reduced model had a lower number of
state variables, determined by the number of neuronal compartments, and is more
suitable for the exploration of parameter spaces in the network description and
DBS protocols. Reduction of the network model followed a bottom-up approach, in
contrast to established methods for reducing the number of state variables to represent
neuronal network activity which are top-down, e.g. mean field models. The approach
followed was to substitute reduced morphology models for the original cell models in
the network. While the effect of morphology reduction on single-cell responses is
studied in various cell types, this was the first study were its effect on network-level
activity is investigated. Results showed that, while individual cell responses and
synchronization properties could be preserved, the network-level activity and its response to
synchronous inputs were subtly altered. Autonomous oscillations in the network,
                                                                                

                                                                                
and resonance with oscillatory inputs were preserved. However, bursting was less
pronounced, the strength of oscillations was increased, and there was a frequency shift
in the resonance peak exhibited by the network. This was related to differences
in the processing of synaptic inputs in the reduced neuron models as a results of
changes in the electrical structures of the cells. The reduced network model can be
extended in the future to incorporate the effects of DBS based on the findings in

   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>6.2   </span> <a id='x11-920006.2'></a>Modeling approach</h3>
<!-- l. 325 --><p class='noindent'>The modeling approach followed in this thesis was that of biophysically detailed,
multi-compartment cable neuron models. The rationale for choosing this methodology was
twofold. First, it allowed to capture the spatially distributed effect of the electric field on
neuron morphologies, which depends strongly on second-order spatial gradients
of the field along neurite elements <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xrattay_basic_1999'>301</a>]</span> and possible interactions with dendritic
voltage-gated ion channels <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xrattay_which_2010'>302</a>]</span>. Second, modeling dendrites allows to take into account
somato-dendritic interactions occurring in neurons as a result of the interplay between
intrinsic and synaptic currents. These effects are known to underlie pathological
bursting in STN neurons <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgillies_membrane_2005'>120</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xbeurrier_subthalamic_1999'>30</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xotsuka_excitatory_2001'>272</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xsong_characterization_2000'>336</a>]</span>, and influence the processing of synaptic
inputs <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xhanson_sodium_2004'>144</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xchan_hcn2_2004'>55</a>]</span>, as well as the synchronization properties of STN and GPe neurons
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xschultheiss_phase_2010'>319</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xfarries_phase_2012'>101</a>]</span>.
</p><!-- l. 339 --><p class='indent'>   Because of the biophysically detailed modeling approach, and the fact that most available
experimental data about basal ganglia pathophysiology comes from rodent experiments,
models were developed to represent the rat brain. This allowed the use of reconstructed
neuron morphologies, detailed anatomical brain atlases, and experimentally validated
biophysical parameters for the neuron and electrical models. The use of animal models for the
investigation of PD pathophysiology and therapies is standard practice. Because of the
evolutionary conservation of basal ganglia nuclei in vertebrates <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgrillner_basal_2016'>130</a>]</span>, the expression
of Parkinsonian pathophysiology after dopaminergic lesioning, and many motor
and non-motor symptoms are replicated between species <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xblesa_classic_2012'>37</a>]</span>. Moreover, evidence
suggests that the mechanism for generation of pathological oscillatory activity is
                                                                                

                                                                                
conserved between rodents and primates <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xsherman_neural_2016'>330</a>]</span>. If this is indeed the case, then insights
into the mechanisms of pathological synchronization, as presented in this thesis,
should remain valid. Although differences in brain anatomy between species require
different electrode configuration and placement, stimulation protocols designed to
desynchronize neural populations based on these insights should be expected to be
transferable.
</p><!-- l. 369 --><p class='indent'>   The approach to model fitting was to start from available cell models that were already
fitted to electrophysiology data, and subsequently constrain the resulting network model using
available data about synaptic physiology and connection patterns reported in the
neurophysiology literature. This was followed by hand-tuning of synaptic weights to obtain
mean population firing rates in agreement with experimentally reported data in rats. This
hand-tuning procedure is <span class='cmti-10x-x-109'>ad hoc</span>, in contrast to established numerical optimization
routines, and is used widely in the field of computational neuroscience. The main
obstacles to numerical optimization are a lack of high-quality datasets available for
model fitting with standardized descriptions of experimental conditions and the
computational resources required to evaluate large network models in each step of an
optimization procedure. In addition, little is known about the convergence properties of
optimization procuedures for network models with high-dimensional parameter landscapes
consisting of parameters that have heterogeneous non-linear effects on network dynamics
and cost functions that balance many, possibly competing objectives. The lack of
such high-quality datasets in combination with the lack of suitable optimization
routines with guaranteed convergence properties, and of established regularization
techniques leads to a high risk of overfitting. This problem is compounded in detailed
models by the higher number of free parameters, particularly those that cannot be
constrained due to a lack of experimental data, leading to higher model variance. On the
other hand, biophysically detailed models have the advantage that their variables
have a direct relationship to biophysical quantities and can therefore more easily be
compared to experimental data. Because of the explicit modeling of biophysical
processes, unrealistic parameter values may result in non-biological behaviors occurring
only in vitro, such as depolarization block occurring when excitatory inputs are too
strong. Hence, unlike in abstract neuron models, unrealistic parameter values can be
identified and rejected more easily. This property reduces the likelihood that the models
presented here are severely overfit with respect to synaptic weights, the primary free
                                                                                

                                                                                
parameters. Moreover, parameter sweeps were performed where possible to inspect
the network behaviour in the local region of the parameter landscape, along axes
corresponding to synaptic weight parameters belonging to one projection type. At least along
these axes, the networks showed gradual transitions in their behavior indicating that
hand-tuned parameters did not correspond to unstable local minima. Similar controls
were carried out by altering the randomly-generated connection matrices. However,
network activity patterns as shown in this thesis could be highly sensitive to other
parameters. The introduction of structured connectivity patterns for example can
strongly influence oscillation patterns, as shown in an early model of the STN-GPe
network <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xterman_activity_2002'>349</a>]</span>. A second important source of variability in network behaviour is
the neuron models used, and how well their biophysical properties capture the in
vivo distribution of neuron responses within a population. This is an active area of
research, and it is well known that multi-objective optimization methods typically used
for neuron model fitting can generate many candidate parameter sets that score
equally well on the objective function <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xvan_geit_automated_2008'>360</a>]</span>, but show difference responses to novel
stimulation patterns. Similarly, these equally performing model candidates may
also show different synchronization properties and lead to different network activity
patterns.

<!-- l. 472 --><p class='noindent'>In order to understand the relation between neural activity patterns and parkinsonian motor
symptoms, the output stages of the basal ganglia projecting to motor command structures in
the brain stem and cortex should be modeled. Only when the link between basal ganglia
activity and motor processing can be made, can stimulation protocols truly be optimized in
terms of their ability to restore normal motor-related activity. To achieve this, a functional
dimension should be added to network models by imposing relationships between
the inputs and outputs of the network that represent motor-related activity and
processing. This could be achieved based on neural recordings at the input and
output stages, and using learning rules for spiking neural networks that modify
synaptic weights <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xabbott_building_2016'>3</a>]</span> to learn input-output relationship that satisfy particular motor
requirements. Such a functional understanding would enable better strategies for
neuromodulation, incorporating specific cost functions in terms of the activity patterns that
should be restored in the network. One major challenge is that learning rules for
biological spiking neural networks are not well understood, and that they would have
to optimize multiple cost functions. Besides input-output relationships, biological
constraints on activity patterns exhibited by the network should be satisfied. To
address this challenge, learning methods for complex cost functions in structured
architectures developed for non-spiking neural networks are being reconciled with
those for spiking networks <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xmarblestone_toward_2016'>229</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xabbott_building_2016'>3</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xdepasquale_using_2016'>81</a>]</span>. This should enhance the understanding
of the relationship between parkinsonian pathophysiology and the disruption of
motor processing, and should lead to the development of more effective stimulation
protocols.
</p><!-- l. 499 --><p class='indent'>   A second way to extend the presented network models, is to integrate the multiple
feedback loops in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical network that are thought to play a role in
the generation and propagation of pathological oscillations. In particular the thalamo-cortical
loop is considered to be a key feedback loop <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xpavlides_computational_2015'>278</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xreis_thalamocortical_2019'>306</a>]</span> and links the core basal ganglia nuclei
of the GP and STN to the cortex, which is believed to drive the generation of pathological
beta-band oscillations <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xsherman_neural_2016'>330</a>]</span> and is key to its suppression <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xli_resonant_2007'>203</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xli_therapeutic_2012'>202</a>]</span>. Modeling the feedback
loops rather than including cortical beta-band activity as an external input will allow
investigation of the effect of multiple circuit resonances in the basal ganglia and how these are
affected by DBS.

<!-- l. 531 --><p class='noindent'>To improve efficacy of existing high-frequency DBS protocols, the model presented in
Chapter (<span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>??</span>) can be used to investigate optimal placement of electrodes and contact
activation, in combination with a more detailed volume conductor model taking into account
different tissue properties. This would allow more precise targeting of neuronal elements
and investigation of their differential contributions to the modulation of network
activity.
</p><!-- l. 539 --><p class='indent'>   Furthermore, the analysis of STN-GPe network activity in Chapter <a href='indexch3.html#x8-410003'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch3:detailed-model  --></a> and the application
of phase-locked stimulation in Chapter <span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>??</span> suggested that altering phase-relationships between
basal ganglia nuclei is a promising method to attenuate pathological oscillations. Indeed,
preliminary data in rats shows that phase-locked stimulation in the STN can desynchronize
local neuronal activity within several stimulation cycles <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xholt_phase-dependent_2019'>155</a>]</span>. Moreover, multi-site HFS
designed to disrupt phase relationships within populations is more effective that continuous
high-frequency DBS in parkinsonian monkeys <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xtass_coordinated_2012'>347</a>]</span>. The current model could be used to
investigate multi-site phase-locked stimulation protocols that alter phase-relationships
by activating different neuronal elements, with mixed orthodromic and antidromic
propagation effects, in a way which would not be possible with simpler single cell
models.

<!-- l. 573 --><p class='noindent'>A key issue that needs to be addressed in future models is that of biological variability in
cellular properties and, in particular, how it is affected by dopamine depletion in Parkinson’s
disease. First, there is considerable heterogeneity in morpho-electric cell types in the brain
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xramaswamy_neocortical_2015'>298</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xzeng_neuronal_2017'>379</a>]</span>, including within basal ganglia nuclei <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xmallet_dichotomous_2012'>225</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xsharott_different_2009'>324</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xsharott_population_2017'>326</a>]</span>. Subtypes of cells can have
different morphological properties, ion channel expression, intracellular signaling pathways,
and take part in fine-grained connection motifs within brain nuclei. All these properties
contribute to variability in responses and firing patterns in these neurons, which reflect their
different functional roles in the network. However, network models more often than not consist
                                                                                

                                                                                
of identical copies of the same cell model within nuclei with uniform connection motifs. If this
diversity in cellular properties is not captured, the emergent activity patterns and the
network’s responses to interventions may not reflect critical features of the biological
network in vivo. The problem of variability can be addressed using high-throughput
electrophysiology methods such as automated patch-clamp, and optimization procedures for
the automatic construction of neuron models based on large datasets <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgouwens_systematic_2018'>125</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xpozzorini_automated_2015'>292</a>]</span>.
Large-scale simultaneous extracellular recordings could also be used to validate the
network model behavior. In this thesis, spiking patterns in the network were validated
based on reported population firing rates and manual tuning of synaptic connection
strengths. However, using the aforementioned learning rules that adapt synaptic
weights based on complex cost functions, this process could be automated and the fit
could be improved by including complex measures based on signal and spike train
analysis.
</p><!-- l. 602 --><p class='indent'>   A second area where data-driven modeling will be key to the success of network models in
designing anti-parkinsonian interventions is the mapping of physiological changes in the basal
ganglia following dopamine depletion, and capturing them in models. Dopamine depletion
affects a variety of signaling cascades involved in regulating ion channel function and the
expression of membrane-bound proteins, synaptic remodeling, and dendritic branching.
However, these changes are often not characterized in a robust quantitative manner but
instead known through sparse observations in unclear experimental conditions. Larger
datasets and the development of standards for experimental data collection and
reporting can help to quantify the effects of these changes on cellular dynamics.
Network models can then help to relate this to large-scale network dynamics and motor
processing.
</p><!-- l. 615 --><p class='indent'>   In summary, data-driven modeling is essential to accelerate the iterative cycle of
model-based hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing, and model refinement. The
speed up of this process will be facilitated by the development and adoption of
new technologies for high-throughput data collection and processing in quantitative
biology.

<!-- l. 628 --><p class='noindent'>The work presented in this thesis demonstrates that valuable insights about neuronal
network dynamics and network mechanisms of neurostimulation can be obtained using
biophysically detailed models. Despite the effort to capture the wealth of biophysical data
available about BG physiology and neurobiology, the models can be extended to include
additional data and biological processes that could reveal new dynamics arising
from the interplay of biophysical processes at different scales. In particular, the role
of biochemical signaling cascades and the dynamics of neurotransmitter release,
receptor binding, and synaptic integration in different classes of synapses remain
under-explored. Given the advent of big data platforms as pioneered by the <a href='https://www.humanbrainproject.eu'>Human
Brain Project</a> and <a href='https://portal.brain-map.org/'>Allen Brain Atlas</a>, incorporation of this level of detail is possible
on a scale that has not been feasible before now. Moreover, biophysically detailed
modeling will undoubtedly become more appealing in the future, with the availability of
next-generation simulators that exploit parallel computing architectures <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xakar_arbor_2019'>12</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xkumbhar_coreneuron_2019'>194</a>]</span>. The work
presented in this thesis can be a stepping stone for researchers wishing to go down
this path to develop future therapies for managing the symptoms of neurological
disorders.
