<!-- l. 50 --><p class='indent'>   Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease,
affecting approximately 1% of the global population over 65 years of age and 5%
of the population over the age of 85 <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#XdeRijk1997prevalence'>77</a>]</span>. It is associated with several motor and
neuropsychiatric symptoms <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xjankovic_parkinsons_2008'>166</a>]</span>, with the primary motor symptoms characterized
by muscular rigidity leading to bradykinesia and akinesia, as well as tremor and
postural instability. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a clinically effective and reversible
therapy to manage the motor symptoms of PD that is most commonly prescribed in
late-stage PD after significant resistance to pharmacological treatment has developed
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xpizzolato_deep_2012'>286</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xbronstein_deep_2011'>41</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xweaver_bilateral_2009'>367</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xbenabid_deep_2009'>27</a>]</span>. DBS is also being considered as a viable treatment option for
early-stage PD motor symptoms <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xschuepbach_neurostimulation_2013'>318</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xhacker_deep_2015'>138</a>]</span> as well as other neurological and psychiatric
disorders <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xlyons_deep_2011'>217</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xkrack_deep_2010'>187</a>]</span>.
</p><!-- l. 76 --><p class='indent'>   Despite its clinical success and widespread adoption as a standard of care, DBS
therapy still has several important shortcomings. On average, it offers only 40-50%
improvement in motor symptoms as assessed by the unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale
(UPDRS) <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xchen2006deep'>59</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xdeuschl_randomized_2006'>84</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xschuepbach_neurostimulation_2013'>318</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xrabie_improvement_2016'>294</a>]</span>. Moreover, the indications for DBS in PD are primarily
akinetic-bradykinetic symptoms and tremor whereas the effectiveness is not clinically
established for the treatment of axial symptoms such as freezing of gait, and for mood
disturbances and cognitive symptoms <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xeisenstein_acute_2014'>92</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xmerola_impulse_2017'>245</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xhuang_deep_2018'>159</a>]</span>. Furthermore, tolerance to DBS therapy
is developed in a subset of patients  <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xkumar_long-term_2003'>192</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xhoueto_failure_2000'>157</a>]</span>, necessitating frequent reprogramming of the
stimulation parameters and different stimulation-induced side effects occur with varying rates
of incidence <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xguehl_statistical_2007'>131</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xbenabid_deep_2009'>27</a>]</span>.

<!-- l. 95 --><p class='noindent'>Overall, the shortcomings of DBS are related to a lack of understanding of its underlying
                                                                                

                                                                                
mechanisms. Although the direct cellular effects of DBS are better understood <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xchiken_mechanism_2016'>61</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xmcintyre_deep_2016'>237</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xjakobs_cellular_2019'>165</a>]</span>,
the picture changes when neurons are embedded in a network and it is still unclear how DBS
impacts the basal ganglia in terms of its network-level activity. This is of particular interest
given that DBS is effectively a non-local intervention that affects activity patterns throughout
the basal ganglia, both downstream and upstream of the stimulation site <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xdorval_deep_2008'>87</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xli_resonant_2007'>203</a>]</span>. Hence a
better understanding of how DBS interacts with BG network activity is needed in order to
overcome its limitations and improve control over Parkinsonian symptoms and stimulation side
effects.
</p><!-- l. 110 --><p class='indent'>   Computational models provide a valuable tool to investigate the mechanism of
action of DBS at both the cellular and network level. Mean-field models of neuronal
populations and single-compartment neuron models are commonly used to answer
questions about network synchronization, whereas multi-compartment cable models
are used to study intracellular biophysical properties of individual neurons and the
interaction with extracellular fields. However, it is becoming clear that macroscopic
synchronization properties and features of neuronal spiking activity relevant to PD
pathophysiology, such as exaggerated bursting, can depend on neuron’s subcellular properties
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xchan_hcn2_2004'>55</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xgillies_membrane_2005'>120</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xschultheiss_phase_2010'>319</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xfarries_biophysical_2012'>100</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xcrook_dendritic_1998'>69</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xgoldberg_response_2007'>123</a>]</span>. The effect of electrical stimulation on a neuron’s output activity
can vary depending on these same subcellular properties, which include non-uniform ion
channel distributions, dendritic branching patterns, and the distribution of synapses over
the cell <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xrattay_which_2010'>302</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xyousif_spatiotemporal_2012'>376</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xsteiner_connectivity_2019'>338</a>]</span>. Despite their importance, computational models of the
basal ganglia focusing on pathophysiology and network interactions with DBS have
so far not included these properties. Moreover, there is now clear evidence that
DBS is a network phenomenon <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xmcintyre_network_2010'>240</a>]</span> therefore network interactions must also be
considered.
</p><!-- l. 134 --><p class='indent'>   Therefore, the first aim of this thesis was to formulate a model of the basal ganglia network
that captures both the essential biophysical properties that shape pathological neuronal unit
and network activity, and the effects exerted by DBS upon the network. The second aim was
to investigate the local cellular and wider network-level effects of DBS upon the basal
ganglia with the aim of better understanding its mechanism of action so that future
therapies may be improved. Finally, the third aim of the thesis was to investigate
what elements of the detailed biophysical model could be dispensed with to arrive
at a compact model that retains its essential biophysical properties but is more
computationally efficient and therefore more suitable for the exploration of parameter
                                                                                

                                                                                
variations in the model. A reduced model enables the development of new closed-loop
stimulation algorithms for DBS by exploring the parameter space of the network,
electrode configuration, and stimulation parameters in a computationally efficient
manner.
</p><!-- l. 152 --><p class='indent'>   Because experimental data about basal ganglia pathophysiology and neurobiology in
the literature and available through public databases derives largely from rodent
models of PD, the computational models developed for this thesis represent the rat
brain. This allowed the use of experimentally validated biophysical parameters and
existing neuron models, increasing biological realism of the models. Animal models
are widely used to investigate PD pathophysiology and the effects of therapeutic
interventions because basal ganglia organization and physiology, and the way PD motor
symptoms are manifested are very similar between species <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgrillner_basal_2016'>130</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xblesa_classic_2012'>37</a>]</span>. Hence the insights
into mechanisms of pathophysiology and mechanism of action of DBS obtained
using the developed models are expected to be transferable to PD patients (see
Section <a href='indexch6.html#x11-920006.2'>6.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:ch6-discussion-modeling-approach  --></a>).

   <h3 class='sectionHead'><span class='titlemark'>1.2   </span> <a id='x6-110001.2'></a>Thesis overview</h3>
<!-- l. 167 --><p class='noindent'>The scientific literature relevant to addressing these problems is reviewed in Chapter <a href='indexch2.html#x7-120002'>2<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch2:lit-review  --></a>. First
Parkinson’s disease is introduced and subsequently its pathophysiological features are
discussed from the perspective of the cellular and subcellular level. Then, pathophysiology at
the network-level is discussed with a focus on pathological synchronization of neuronal activity
and the relation to Parkinsonian motor symptoms. Experimental and modeling studies
focusing on the mechanisms of DBS are reviewed, and a final section reviews different
approaches to computational modeling.
</p><!-- l. 177 --><p class='indent'>   A new model of the subthalamo-pallidal network consisting of biophysically detailed cell
models is presented in Chapter <a href='indexch3.html#x8-410003'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch3:detailed-model  --></a>. This network consists of a reciprocal loop between two
nuclei of the basal ganglia that is considered key for the generation of pathological activity
patterns and their disruption by DBS. The model is used to investigate how pathological
oscillations and bursting can arise in this network through network interactions between its
populations, and through the interaction between synaptic and intrinsic currents in dendritic
                                                                                

                                                                                
structures. The model shows how phase locking of subthalamic and pallidal neurons and
exaggerated bursting in subthalamic neurons can arise from the interaction of these currents
when the balance of excitation and inhibition is changed and how phase locking is
amplified under specific phase relationships between cortical and striatal beta-band
inputs.
</p><!-- l. 202 --><p class='indent'>   In Chapter <span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>??</span>, the cellular and network effects of DBS are investigated using the
biophysically detailed model presented in the previous Chapter <a href='indexch3.html#x8-410003'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch3:detailed-model  --></a>. This is the first model
where neurons are simultaneously affected by the applied electric field along their entire
morphologies and embedded in a network model, so that both efferent and afferent axons to
each neuron are susceptible to stimulation. This enables the characterization of cellular and
network effects of DBS while stimulus-locked action potentials can propagate both
orthodromically and antidromically along each axon, with synapses at the terminals exhibiting
short-term plasticity affected by this stimulation. Using the model, it is demonstrated how
the dissociation between somatic and axonal stimulus-locked spiking in neurons is
determined by the degree of short-term depression in excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
Furthermore, the model is used to investigate the effects of low-frequency stimulation
phase-locked to the frequency of beta-band oscillations in cortical inputs to the network.
By applying phase-locked DBS, it is shown how the suppression of oscillations in
the network depends on the phase of stimulation by altering the relative phases of
population spiking activity in the network. Simulation results reveal an optimal
phase of stimulation for the suppression of beta-band oscillations which occurs when
pulses are applied 180 degrees out-of-phase with respect to the onset of cortical
bursts.
</p><!-- l. 227 --><p class='indent'>   The biophysically detailed neuron models used in the network models presented in
Chapters <a href='indexch3.html#x8-410003'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch3:detailed-model  --></a> and <span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>??</span> capture a high level of physiological detail and can simulate characteristic
behaviours of subthalamic nucleus (STN) and external globus pallidus (GPe) neurons.
However, the large number of neuronal compartments within the individual neuron
models results in a high computational complexity which make the network model
computationally expensive to simulate and unwieldy for the exploration of parameter
variations in the network or stimulation protocol. To address this problem, in Chapter <a href='indexch5.html#x10-670005'>5<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch5:reduced-model  --></a>
a derived network model is presented where reduced morphology neuron models
are substituted for the original, detailed neuron models. First, a model reduction
procedure is presented based on the collapsing of dendritic branches into equivalent cable
                                                                                

                                                                                
structures. The reduction procedure is shown to conserve somatic responses and
synchronization properties of detailed single neuron models. Then the resulting
network model is used to show how key synchronization properties and neuronal
firing patterns of the detailed network model are conserved, while differences are
related to changes in the electrical properties of neurons introduced by the reduction
procedure.
</p><!-- l. 248 --><p class='indent'>   Finally, in Chapter <a href='indexch6.html#x11-870006'>6<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch6:conclusions  --></a> the results presented in this thesis, its conclusions and contributions
toward the understanding of DBS for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease are summarized.
Future directions based on this research are also discussed.
