<!-- l. 26 --><p class='noindent'>Beta-band oscillatory activity and exaggerated bursting in the STN-GPe network are key
features of parkinsonian pathophysiology that are correlated with its akinetic-bradykinetic
motor symptoms <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xsharott_dopamine_2005'>325</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xmallet_disrupted_2008'>224</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xkuhn_high-frequency_2008'>189</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xsanders_parkinsonism-related_2013'>314</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xsharott_activity_2014'>323</a>]</span>. Moreover, improvements in those symptoms
correlate with their suppression by DBS. Hence, capturing these features is essential for
computational models whose purpose it is to optimize DBS stimulation protocols. The
biophysically detailed network model of the STN-GPe loop presented in Chapter <a href='indexch3.html#x8-410003'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch3:detailed-model  --></a> exhibited
                                                                                

                                                                                
spontaneous beta-band synchronization and resonance behavior in Parkinsonian conditions,
and synchronization in the network occurred together with strong burst firing in STN neurons.
However, because of the biophysical detail captured by the model, it consists of a large number
of state variables and high computational complexity. This leads to long simulation times that
make the model impractical for the efficient exploration of DBS parameter settings,
where simulation of large numbers of neurons at very small timescales is required.
Moreover computational complexity limits the ability to scale up the size of the
network to realistic numbers of neurons, equaling approximately 13,000 cells in the rat
subthalamic nucleus (STN) and 30,000 in the external globus pallidus (GPe), unilaterally
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xoorschot_absolute_1999'>269</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xabdi_prototypic_2015'>5</a>]</span>.
</p><!-- l. 52 --><p class='indent'>   At the same time, the high level of biophysical detail captured by the model confers it with
several key advantages. First, the neuron models used can reproduce spiking features that are
mediated by the interaction between dendritic ion channels and synaptic currents. Indeed, bursting
in STN neurons is a phenomenon mediated by the generation of voltage plateaus originating
from <!-- l. 57 --><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><mi>C</mi><msup><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo class='MathClass-bin'>+</mo></mrow></msup></math>
influx in distal dendrites <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgillies_membrane_2005'>120</a>]</span>. In addition to network topology and synaptic strengths,
dendritic processing of synaptic inputs also influences the synchronization properties of
neurons, both by passive propagation and by the engagement of active ion channels <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xschultheiss_phase_2010'>319</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xgoldberg_response_2007'>123</a>]</span>.
Another major advantage of detailed multi-compartment models is that the effects of
extracellular electrical stimulation can be modeled using spatially varying extracellular
potentials. This captures its distributed interaction with the membrane rather than
assuming a single equivalent source modifying the neuron’s output, often located at the
soma.
</p><!-- l. 71 --><p class='indent'>   To preserve the advantages of the biophysically detailed model it is desirable to have an
intermediate level of description that retains its straightforward relation to the underlying
biophysiology of the system while reducing the computational complexity of the model to
achieve computational efficiency. One way to address this problem, is the use of
methods for the systematic reduction of detailed morphological neuron models into
equivalent cable models. Such methods were explored early in the development of
neuronal cable models, starting with the ‘3/2 rule’ for collapsing passive branching
structures into analytically equivalent cylinders <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xrall_branching_1959'>295</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xrall1964theoretical'>296</a>]</span>. This rule states that
neurites originating at a branch point can be replaced by an equivalent cylinder
that preserves passive outward voltage attenuation if the branch point obeys the
                                                                                

                                                                                
3/2 power rule. In short, the sum of the 3/2 power of child branch diameters must
equal the 3/2 power of the parent branch diameter, biophysical properties must be
uniform, and the child branches must terminate at the same electrotonic distance from
the branch point. These limitations were relaxed in subsequent reduction methods,
producing equivalent cables for passive dendrites with arbitrary geometries, in terms of
outward voltage attenuation <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xclements1989cable'>65</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xstratford1989modelling'>339</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xdouglas1992exploring'>89</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xohme1998equivalent'>267</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xfleshman1988electrotonic'>106</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xevans2000analysis'>98</a>]</span>. However, because local input
impedances are altered by those methods, voltage transients in response to dendritic
current sources are not preserved. This means that the local effects and inward
propagation of transients evoked by active ion channels or synaptic currents are not
preserved. To address the case of nonlinear ionic and synaptic conductances in the
dendrites, heuristic methods were developed that preserve certain key electrical
properties but these often require additional fitting or manual fine tuning steps
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xtraub_model_1991'>356</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xbush_reduced_1993'>46</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xpinsky_intrinsic_1994'>284</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xdavison_reduced_2000'>74</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xmarasco_fast_2012'>228</a>]</span>.
</p><!-- l. 104 --><p class='indent'>   Despite their ability to substantially reduce the computational complexity of branching
neuron models, morphology reduction methods are limited in their ability to accurately
preserve the full spectrum of responses of detailed models <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xhendrickson_capabilities_2011'>150</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xelbasiouny_development_2014'>93</a>]</span>. Most importantly, all
morphology reduction methods suffer from the input impedance problem <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xdeschutter2000computational'>78</a>]</span> where
the local input impedance seen at points on the dendrites is different from that
in the original model. As a result, dendritic current sources such as synapses will
generally not produce identical voltage transients and, therefore, their coupling to
voltage-sensitive ionic conductances is altered. Moreover, after collapsing dendritic branches,
synapses that were originally spatially and electrically isolated are mapped to the same
location, reducing voltage compartmentalization and introducing mutual shunting
effects. As a result of these limitations, neuronal responses that depend strongly on
dendritic input impedance and activation of dendritic active channels are generally not
accurately reproduced when the reduction eliminates a high degree of branching
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xhendrickson_capabilities_2011'>150</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xelbasiouny_development_2014'>93</a>]</span>. Nevertheless, intermediate levels of reduction that preserve a certain degree of
branching can be used to reproduce key features of the neuron’s responses <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xhendrickson_capabilities_2011'>150</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xelbasiouny_development_2014'>93</a>]</span>. If
these features are sufficient to preserve key properties of neuronal network behavior,
morphology reduction would be a suitable strategy to study the network effects of
physiological and electrical interventions such as deep brain stimulation (DBS).
The capabilities of reduced morphology models to reproduce single cell responses
of their more detailed counterparts were investigated systematically in <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xhendrickson_capabilities_2011'>150</a>]</span> for
                                                                                

                                                                                
GPe neurons and in <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xelbasiouny_development_2014'>93</a>]</span> for motor neurons. However, their ability to reproduce
neuronal network activity and network synchronization properties has not yet been
investigated.
</p><!-- l. 133 --><p class='indent'>   From the perspective of network synchronization, one way to quantify how well the
features of a neuron’s response properties are captured by an equivalent model are phase
response curves (PRC). In general, PRC quantify the phase perturbation of an oscillating
system in response to an input arriving at a specific phase of its ongoing oscillation. In
neurons, therefore, PRC give the phase advance or delay of the following spike as a function of
the phase at which an input arrives during the inter-spike interval (ISI). An important
theoretical result is that the shape of the PRC predicts the tendency of neurons to synchronize
to oscillatory inputs, and can also predict synchronization patterns arising in mutually
connected populations of oscillating neurons, depending on their connection types
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xhansel_synchrony_1995'>143</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xermentrout_type_1996'>96</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xgoldberg_response_2007'>123</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xachuthan_phase-resetting_2009'>7</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xbogaard_interaction_2009'>38</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xabouzeid_type-ii_2009'>6</a>]</span>. Moreover the shape of the PRC is determined by both passive
filtering properties of dendrites and nonlinearities introduced by active conductances
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgoldberg_response_2007'>123</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xgutkin_phase-response_2005'>137</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xcrook_dendritic_1998'>69</a>]</span>, which are present in GPe and STN neuron dendrites. It may, therefore,
be expected that PRC provide a suitable way to compare the characteristics of
candidate model neurons when the aim is to investigate network synchronization
properties.
</p><!-- l. 174 --><p class='indent'>   Therefore the aim of this study was to reduce the biophysically detailed network model of
the STN-GPe loop presented in Chapter <a href='indexch3.html#x8-410003'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch3:detailed-model  --></a> to a more tractable number of compartments while
maintaining key features of network activity and its frequency response. To achieve this, a
morphology reduction algorithm was applied that reduced the detailed multi-compartmental
neuron models to equivalent cable models consisting of fewer compartments. To gauge
whether the essential input-output characteristics of the model neurons were captured
before simulating the complete network, two methods were used. First, responses of
model neurons to current clamp protocols designed to elicit stereotypical responses
were compared to ascertain that crucial features such as bursting and spontaneous
oscillations were conserved. Second, phase response curves of the model neurons were
compared to measure how model neurons synchronized to their synaptic inputs. Finally,
the behaviour of the reduced network model was compared with that of the full
model presented in Chapter <a href='indexch3.html#x8-410003'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch3:detailed-model  --></a> to investigate whether synchronization properties,
neuronal activity patterns, and the network response to cortical oscillatory inputs were
preserved.

normalized to 1 micron resulting in very short lengths of dendritic branches (see

curves</h4>
<!-- l. 695 --><p class='noindent'>To measure how the detailed and reduced models synchronized to their synaptic inputs, PRC
were measured using synaptic inputs located at biologically realistic locations in the cells’
dendritic trees (Ch. <a href='indexch3.html#x8-430003.2'>3.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: sec:ch3-methods  --></a>, Fig. <a href='indexch3.html#x8-420011'>3.1<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:network_diagram  --></a>).
</p><!-- l. 702 --><p class='indent'>   In the STN neuron models, excitatory PRC were positive for synaptic inputs arriving in
the middle segment of the ISI and had smaller negative regions near the start and end of the
ISI (Fig. <a href='#x10-780015'>5.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:stn-full-vs-red_PRC-curves  --></a>.A, B). Although small negative regions at the start of the ISI are commonly
permitted in classification of type I PRC, due to stimulation during the downstroke of the
action potential, the negative region at the end of the ISI indicates a type II PRC.
When the excitatory synapse was placed farther down the dendrite, more distally to
the soma, the negative region at the end of the ISI became larger and covered a
larger phase interval and the magnitude of the phase shift was reduced. This vertical
scaling of the PRC as the synapse is moved to a more distant location in the dendrite
reflects increased attenuation of post-synaptic potentials originating at distant sites.
Excitatory PRCs were well preserved in the reduced cell model (Fig. <a href='#x10-780015'>5.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:stn-full-vs-red_PRC-curves  --></a>.Aii, Bii),
with only small deviation between polynomial fits to the PRC samples. Inhibitory
PRC were negative for synaptic inputs arriving in the middle segment of the ISI
and had positive regions at the start and end of the ISI (Fig. <a href='#x10-780015'>5.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:stn-full-vs-red_PRC-curves  --></a>.C). Phase shifts
elicited by stimuli arriving late in the ISI showed a large variance, reflecting a large
residual influence of past stimuli on ion channels governing the membrane voltage.
This was the case in both the detailed and reduced cell model, resulting in a larger
mismatch between PRC for later phases, while the match in early phases was close
(Fig. <a href='#x10-780015'>5.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:stn-full-vs-red_PRC-curves  --></a>.C).

STN-GPe network <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xkuhn_reduction_2006'>190</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xweinberger_beta_2006'>369</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xeusebio_deep_2011'>97</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xray_local_2008'>303</a>]</span>, the frequency response in this band should be
maintained in the reduced network if the model is to be used to optimize DBS stimulation
prototocols.
</p><!-- l. 794 --><p class='indent'>   The first key behavior exhibited by the detailed network model of Chapter <a href='indexch3.html#x8-410003'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch3:detailed-model  --></a> was its
ability to show weak spontaneous oscillations in the beta-band range with the oscillation
frequency depending on degree of excitation by cortical inputs (Fig. <a href='indexch3.html#x8-520012'>3.2<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:endogenous_sweep-gmax-ctx-stn_A-psd-currents  --></a>, <a href='indexch3.html#x8-5300410'>3.10<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:endogenous_sweep-gaba-AB-gpe-stn_AC-psd-all  --></a>). This behavior
was retained in the reduced network model, with differences observed in the power of
beta-band and low-frequency (2-5 Hz) oscillations (Fig. <a href='#x10-790017'>5.7<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_spont_sweep-g-ctx-stn  --></a>).
</p><!-- l. 802 --><p class='indent'>   In the detailed network model, increasing the strength of cortical excitation revealed a
parameter region at intermediate synaptic strengths where strong low-frequency
bursting (2-5 Hz) in the STN co-occurred with weak synchronization (Fig. <a href='#x10-790017'>5.7<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_spont_sweep-g-ctx-stn  --></a>,

Although this parameter region is present in the reduced network model, the power of
low-frequency oscillations is lower (Fig. <a href='#x10-790017'>5.7<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_spont_sweep-g-ctx-stn  --></a>, right column). The reduction in low-frequency
power was related to the fact that the reduced STN neuron models were less prone to bursting
(Fig. <a href='#x10-790017'>5.7<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_spont_sweep-g-ctx-stn  --></a>.C): with a synaptic strength corresponding to the maximum low-frequency power

<!-- l. 829 --><p class='indent'>   The second key behavior of the detailed network model was resonance of the STN-GPe
feedback loop with cortical beta-band activity arriving via CTX-STN afferents. The resonance
behavior was qualitatively retained by the reduced network model (Fig. <a href='#x10-790028'>5.8<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_sweep-f-burst  --></a>) but the
resonance peaks in the STN and GPe populations were shifted toward the lower
frequency range by approximately 6 Hz (Fig. <a href='#x10-790028'>5.8<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_sweep-f-burst  --></a>.C,D) and increased in magnitude. The
phase vector lengths were also increased (Fig. <a href='#x10-790028'>5.8<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_sweep-f-burst  --></a>.C), indicating stronger phase
synchronization to the cortical oscillation in STN and GPe spike trains. This occurred
despite the close match in phase response curves, indicating that PRC alone are not a
good predictor of synchronization strength. For example, between 15-18 Hz there
is a large discrepancy in the strength of phase synchronization between the full
and reduced models. This discrepancy could be explained, however, by differences
in excitability and firing rates between the two models: the decrease in resonance
frequency and increase in resonance strength was accompanied by lower firing rates in
STN neurons but not in GPe neurons (Fig. <a href='#x10-790039'>5.9<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_sweep-f-burst_currents-EI  --></a>.C). Moreover, the total synaptic
currents delivered to STN and GPe neurons were decreased (Fig. <a href='#x10-790039'>5.9<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_sweep-f-burst_currents-EI  --></a>.A-B, shaded

</p><!-- l. 846 --><p class='indent'>   The downward shift in resonance frequency in the reduced model mirrors the results of
Chapter <a href='indexch3.html#x8-410003'>3<!-- tex4ht:ref: ch3:detailed-model  --></a> where the the frequency of maximal phase locking decreases with the ratio of
excitation to inhibition and the strength of phase locking increases (Fig. <a href='indexch3.html#x8-5400213'>3.13<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:exogenous_ctx-resonance-response_B-vectorlength  --></a>.B-C). Although
STN neurons in the reduced model have a lower firing rate and the net synaptic
current is smaller in the frequency range of resonance, the estimated E/I ratio is not
consistently lower (Fig. <a href='#x10-790039'>5.9<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_sweep-f-burst_currents-EI  --></a>.A). This paradoxical observation could be due to inaccurate
estimation of the E/I ratio based on recordings in only 6 % of cells or it could be due to
the increased effectiveness of inhibition in the electrically compact reduced neuron
model.

synapse strength (Fig. <a href='#x10-7900410'>5.10<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_ctx-burst_sweep-g-ctx-stn  --></a>). The shift of the resonance peak was related to features of the

<!-- l. 966 --><p class='noindent'>A reduced model of the STN-GPe network that retains key properties of a biophysically
detailed model is presented. The model was generated in an automated fashion based on
cellular morphology reduction algorithms applied to the multi-compartment cell models that
make up the detailed network model. The reduced network model represents a reduction in
state variables of 85.5 % and computation time of 79 % over the detailed model. This study
demonstrates that reduced models of neuronal networks can be constructed with relative ease
based on detailed characterizations of the component cells. The reduced network model retains
the same phenomenological behavior with only small differences in quantitative properties
such as mean population firing rates. Such reduced models are computationally
more efficient and may be more appropriate to explore the network behavior under
different input and parameter settings when the use of more complex models is not
feasible. Furthermore, they offer the prospect of fast implementations of network
models that can enable real-time optimization of stimulation parameters in the
clinic.

<!-- l. 987 --><p class='noindent'>The algorithm for the reduction of detailed neuronal morphologies into equivalent cable
structures used here followed the approach of conserving the axial resistance per unit length
but not the surface area, first described in <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xbush_reduced_1993'>46</a>]</span>. This algorithm was extended in <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xmarasco_fast_2012'>228</a>]</span> using
empirical scaling rules to handle the case of dendritic active and synaptic conductances. This
approach was chosen because active dendritic conductances were present in the STN and GPe
neuron models. However, the algorithm was modified by altering the way compartments were
clustered and merged into equivalent cables. Rather than recursively merging cylindrical
compartments as in <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xmarasco_fast_2012'>228</a>]</span>, yielding an equivalent cable with uniform diameter, the clustering
approach of <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xdouglas1992exploring'>89</a>]</span> was followed, preserving the gradual tapering of neurite diameters
with distance from the soma. It was found that this method yielded a better match
                                                                                

                                                                                
in burst responses mediated by dendritic ion channels in STN neurons. This was
related to the higher local input impedance in the distal dendrites obtained using this
method.
</p><!-- l. 1003 --><p class='indent'>   <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xhendrickson_capabilities_2011'>150</a>]</span> and <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xelbasiouny_development_2014'>93</a>]</span> previously investigated the capabilities of reduced morphology models to
conserve the response properties of detailed models. They concluded that responses that
depend strongly on dendritic input impedance and activation of dendritic active channels are
not accurately reproduced by such models. However, they show that their accuracy can be
improved by limiting the level of reduction, maintaining a degree of branching in the
equivalent cables. The results support these conclusions: the choice of a reduction method
resulting in tapering equivalent cables as well as the conservation of dendritic branching all
served to obtain a better match in input impedance properties. Specifically, it was found to be
necessary to limit the reduction to the merging of sections starting at each dendritic trunk
section, resulting in a branched model rather than a single equivalent cable (data
not shown). Despite these choices, the bursting response of STN neurons, which is
mediated by dendritic active currents, was still not fully preserved in the reduced cell
model.

<!-- l. 1024 --><p class='noindent'>An alternative morphology reduction algorithm was used in <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xhendrickson_capabilities_2011'>150</a>]</span> to construct equivalent cable
models of the same detailed GPe model used in this study <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgunay_channel_2008'>133</a>]</span>. The algorithm used in that
study preserves the total surface area of equivalent cables and outward passive attenuation of

This algorithm was not used in this study because tapering diameters were found necessary
to match responses of the STN model. It is possible that this requirement is less
important in the GPe model because ion channel densities are distributed uniformly
in that model, and it has no characteristic responses mediated solely by distally
distributed ion channels. Stereotypical responses of the GPe model were faithfully
reproduced by the reduced model presented here (Fig. <a href='#x10-770024'>5.4<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:gpe-full-vs-red_protos-clamp  --></a>) and phase response
curves also showed an excellent match (Fig. <a href='#x10-780026'>5.6<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:gpe-full-vs-red_PRC-curves  --></a>). Note that in the original <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgunay_channel_2008'>133</a>]</span> GPe

micron in length. This limitation was preserved since it was necessary to match the

<!-- l. 1057 --><p class='noindent'>The reduced STN neuron model showed small differences in its responses
compared to the detailed model (Fig. <a href='#x10-770013'>5.3<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:stn-full-vs-red_protos-clamp  --></a>). Burst and plateau responses were
shortened in duration leading to a smaller number of spikes per burst. This
shortening was related to the dynamics of generation and termination of the
<!-- l. 1061 --><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML' display='inline'><mi>C</mi><msup><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo class='MathClass-bin'>+</mo></mrow></msup></math>-mediated
plateau originating in the distal regions of the dendrites. These dynamics are regulated by the
interplay of voltage-gated CaT, CaL, and sKCa channels with local membrane voltage
dynamics <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgillies_membrane_2005'>120</a>]</span>. In the reduced model, the reduced input impedance in distal dendrites results
in lower-amplitude membrane voltage depolarizations, leading to altered dynamics of
voltage-dependent channel gating variables. Specifically, due to decreased gate open fractions,
the amplitude of ionic currents is lowered (data not shown), resulting in shortening of the
self-sustaining CaT-mediated plateau. Phase response curves matched well with those of
the detailed model when fitted curves were compared. However, there was a large
variability in phase shifts in some regions of the PRC. Particularly for inhibitory stimuli
arriving at late phases, and distal excitatory phases arriving at early phases the
variability was high (Fig. <a href='#x10-780015'>5.5<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:stn-full-vs-red_PRC-curves  --></a>.B, C). This variability is related to the randomization of
stimulus timings during measurement of the PRC: because stimulus timings are
randomized in successive ISIs, their residual influence in the following ISI varies between
PRC samples. This residual influence is determined both by passive dissipation
of stimulus-induced PSP and the interaction with ion channel currents through
                                                                                

                                                                                
voltage-gated states. Because several gating variables have long time constants, the
residual influence of the associated ionic currents is considerable in some sampled ISIs.
Hence, while the phase response characteristic of STN neurons is preserved by the
morphology reduction method, the altered electrical properties resulting from the
collapsing of neurites limit its ability to faithfully reproduce responses in the reduced
model.

that is also by definition negative. This is because stimulus times are defined here as the time
of spike arrival at the synapse, whereas in <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xfarries_phase_2012'>101</a>]</span> the stimulus time was taken to be the time
halfway through the PSP. However, the negative part of STN PRC occurring at

clearly different from the study by <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xfarries_phase_2012'>101</a>]</span> and is not accounted for by differences in the
calculation method. This could result from the fact that PRC were measured in this study
while STN neurons were in a more excited state (made to fire at 20 Hz), whereas in the study
by <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xfarries_phase_2012'>101</a>]</span> they were measured during slower spontaneous firing. Moreover, the magnitude of
post-synaptic potentials are different. The different membrane polarization level as a result of
these factors could cause interactions with voltage-gated channels that do not occur during
spontaneous firing. Alternatively, there could be differences in the membrane dynamics
captured by the <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xgillies_membrane_2005'>120</a>]</span> STN neuron model and present in the biological neurons recorded by

in different processing properties of synaptic inputs, as shown in other neuron types <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xhendrickson_capabilities_2011'>150</a>, <a href='indexli5.html#Xelbasiouny_development_2014'>93</a>]</span>.
In particular, the propensity of single-compartment models to burst when embedded in
network models was found to be lower compared to branch models, based on other
simulation experiments (data not shown). This is likely related to the ability of
different dendritic regions to act as semi-independent subunits that are electrically
separated in multi-compartment models <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xwybo_electrical_2019'>374</a>]</span>. However, to establish this quantitatively,
detailed comparisons of the responses to synaptic inputs between single-compartment
and multi-compartment neuron models with various degrees of reduction should be
performed.

models. However, the changes in electrical properties of the cell models introduced changes in
the integration of synaptic currents and their interaction with intrinsic ionic currents through
the local membrane voltage. The total synaptic current delivered during network
simulation was smaller in the reduced cell models (Fig. <a href='#x10-790039'>5.9<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_sweep-f-burst_currents-EI  --></a>). In STN neurons this was
accompanied by a shift in the balance of currents toward slightly higher excitation
and, paradoxically, a lower firing rate. The decrease in synaptic current delivered is
likely related to the mutual shunting of synapses <span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xsegev_what_2006'>322</a>]</span> lumped closer together in
the dendritic trees of the reduced models compared to the detailed morphologies,

somatic membrane voltages in each population, spectral power at 20 Hz is related
to the sinusoidal character of the STN neuron’s membrane voltages: the shorter
bursts with increased intra-burst firing rate and sparser firing between bursts in
the reduced model ((Fig. <a href='#x10-7900410'>5.10<!-- tex4ht:ref: fig:net-full-vs-red_ctx-burst_sweep-g-ctx-stn  --></a>.Ci - Cii)) contribute to sharpening of the sinusoidal

<!-- l. 1208 --><p class='noindent'>When reducing a detailed morphology to an equivalent cable model, the properties of the
resulting model depend strongly on the reduction algorithm used, the trade-offs
inherent in the algorithm, and the choice of its parameters such as the degree of
reduction. Further studies are needed to show which reduction algorithms and parameter
choices are the most suitable to reproduce specific aspects of neuron and neuronal
network behavior. Furthermore, the optimal method might also depend on the specific
complement of ion channels present in the cell and its spatial distribution in the dendritic
tree. An additional concern when choosing a reduction method is the size of the
network and its connectivity, which determine the number of synapses modeled on
each cell. As this number increases, more synapses are lumped together in the same
or neighboring compartments, warranting different degrees of reduction to avoid
excessive mutual shunting effects. Firing rates and patterns should also be taken
into account, as they determine the degree of temporal overlap of post-synaptic
potentials.
</p><!-- l. 1223 --><p class='indent'>   Another open question is the use of reduced morphology models to study the effects of
extracellular electrical stimulation. Given that all morphology reduction algorithms alter

extracellular stimulation activates ion channels through local membrane voltage fluctuations
<span class='cite'>[<a href='indexli5.html#Xjohnson_quantifying_2008'>168</a>]</span> that are dependent on the cell’s electrotonic properties such as local input
impedance. Hence, reproducing the effects of electrical stimulation is another goal
that warrants careful selection of reduction algorithms and characterization of its
effects.
</p><!-- l. 1236 --><p class='indent'>   An alternative approach to bottom-up reduction of neuron models is state space reduction

describing the membrane dynamics in each neuronal compartment is reduced by analyzing
their trajectories in phase space and projecting them to a lower dimensional space. This
reduction approach has only been applied to single compartment neuron models so far.
Extending it to multi-compartmental neuron models could potentially preserve the influence of
neuron geometries on their responses to electrical stimulation. However, the reduction of
voltage-dependent dynamics of individual ion channel states to lower-dimensional
trajectories would then also have to account for the effect of extracellular time-varying
voltage sources. Another approach that foregoes coupling the electrical model to the
neural network model during the simulation is to use the insights about cellular
activation from a detailed model (as in Chapter <span class='cmbx-10x-x-109'>??</span>) to make assumptions about
which cellular structures are activated. Eliminating the requirement for coupling the
electrical model to the neuronal cable models can substantially reduce the computation

PRC of cells reduced using different algorithms and different degrees of reduction

<!-- l. 1307 --><p class='noindent'>In summary, a bottom-up model reduction method for network models based on the
substitution of equivalent cable models for morphologically detailed cell model is presented.
The method was used to reduce a biophysically detailed model of the STN-GPe
network to an equivalent network model with a reduced number of state variables
and lower computational complexity. While key properties of the original network
model were preserved, firing patterns and the response to synchronous inputs were
subtly altered: burst responses were shortened, influencing power spectra of neuronal
activation patterns, and there was a frequency shift in the resonance peak shown in the
frequency response of the original model. These differences in firing patterns can
be related back to the inability of the morphology reduction method to precisely
preserve neuronal responses that are strongly dependent on dendritic ion channel
engagement, which is most evident in the burst responses generated by STN neurons.
Moreover, these results shows that small differences in individual cell properties
                                                                                

                                                                                
pre- and post-reduction can lead to differences in emergent activity patterns. The
observed differences in the spiking patterns and frequency response of the network were
quantitatively small however, and may be improved in the future by adding compensatory
changes in synaptic scaling or electrical cell parameters that need to be further
investigated. These results indicate that neuronal morphology reduction methods can be a
valuable approach to study the responses of large networks of cells that maintain a
close relationship to the underlying physiology. Due to their reduced computational
complexity, the resulting network models could be used for the design and testing of DBS
protocols in silico, when subcellular biophysical interactions need to be accounted
for.
